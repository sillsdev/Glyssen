FuzzySharp.dll is a NuGet package that (as of Sept 2023) is not strong-named. I used the StrongNamer package to create a signed version of it, but it seems the signed package does not get copied into the folders where tests are built, nor is it included in the NuGet packages that Glyssen creates. Rather than requiring all down-stream packages to explicitly include both FuzzySharp and StrongNamer, I am checking in the signed version of FuzzySharp. This will be an extra hassle if a newer version of that package is ever released and we want to upgrade.
