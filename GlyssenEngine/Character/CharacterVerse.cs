		/// indicates past speech, this quote type is used to distinguish between the character presumed to be

		/// the performance hit to look in the reference text to see whether the alternate character is used.
		/// This type can also be used when there is a potential quote that spills over into a subsequent verse
		/// that has an actual expected quote. Some translations (e.g., ISV) wrap virtually the entire text in
		/// quotes to indicate that the prophet is speaking all the text. In these cases, the actual quote may
		/// be second level. For translations that do not do this, we don't want the prophet to accidentally be
		/// considered as a candidate for the quoted text (which would result in an ambiguity). By using the

		/// which case it should definitely be dramatized. But it might just be an unexpressed thought,
		/// spelled out literally for the sake of the audience, in which case, the target community will
		/// need to decide whether to dramatize it or have it read by the narrator. If a verse has only Rare quotes and the parser finds a
		/// quote in that verse, it will be regarded as unexpected, but in Identify Speaking Parts, the rare
		/// speaker(s) will appear (along with the narrator) in the list of choices. So at least for now,
