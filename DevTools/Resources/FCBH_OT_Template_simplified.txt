GEN	2	4	Narr_01: Genesis	#19		44	 {4} This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created. When the Lord God made the earth and the heavens--
GEN	2	5	Narr_01: Genesis	#19		45	" {5} and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to work the ground,"

GEN	2	21	Narr_01: Genesis	#19		64	 {21} So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep.
GEN	2	21	Narr_01: Genesis	#19		65	" While he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh."
GEN	2	22	Narr_01: Genesis	#19		66	" {22} Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. {23} The man said,"

DEU	3	13	Narr_05: Deuteronomy	#19		6254	 (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites.
DEU	3	14	Narr_05: Deuteronomy	#19		6255	" {14} Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites;"
DEU	3	14	Narr_05: Deuteronomy	#19		6256	" it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair .)"
DEU	3	15	Moses	#01		6257	 {15} And I gave Gilead to Makir.
DEU	3	16	Moses	#01		6258	" {16} But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites."
DEU	3	17	Moses	#01		6259	" {17} Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) , below the slopes of Pisgah."
DEU	3	18	Moses	#01		6260	 {18} I commanded you at that time: ôThe Lord your God has given you this land to take possession of it.
DEU	3	18	Moses	#01		6261	" But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of your brother Israelites."
DEU	3	19	Moses	#01		6262	" {19} However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you,"
DEU	3	20	Moses	#01		6263	" {20} until the Lord gives rest to your brothers as he has to you, and they too have taken over the land that the Lord your God is giving them, across the Jordan."
DEU	3	20	Moses	#01		6264	" After that, each of you may go back to the possession I have given you.ö"
DEU	3	21	Moses	#01		6265	 {21} At that time I commanded Joshua: ôYou have seen with your own eyes all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings.
DEU	3	21	Moses	#01		6266	 The Lord will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going.
DEU	3	22	Moses	#01		6267	 {22} Do not be afraid of them; the Lord your God himself will fight for you.ö {23} At that time I pleaded with the Lord:
DEU	3	24	Moses	#01		6268	" {24} ôO Sovereign Lord, you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do?"
DEU	3	25	Moses	#01		6269	" {25} Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan --that fine hill country and Lebanon .ö {26} But because of you the Lord was angry with me and would not listen to me. The Lord said,"
DEU	3	26	God-FX1	#20		6270	 << That is enough. Do not speak to me anymore about this matter.
DEU	3	27	God-FX1	#20		6271	" {27} Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan."
DEU	3	28	God-FX1	#20		6272	" {28} But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.>>"

DEU	4	1	Moses	#01		6276	" Follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land that the Lord, the God of your fathers, is giving you."
DEU	4	2	Moses	#01		6277	" {2} Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the Lord your God that I give you."
DEU	4	3	Moses	#01		6278	 {3} You saw with your own eyes what the Lord did at Baal Peor.
DEU	4	3	Moses	#01		6279	" The Lord your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor, {4} but all of you who held fast to the Lord your God are still alive today."
DEU	4	5	Moses	#01		6280	" {5} See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the Lord my God commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it."
DEU	4	6	Moses	#01		6281	" {6} Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say,"
DEU	4	6	Nation	#16		6282	 << Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.>>
DEU	4	7	Moses	#01		6283	 {7} What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the Lord our God is near us whenever we pray to him?
DEU	4	8	Moses	#01		6284	 {8} And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?
DEU	4	9	Moses	#01		6285	" {9} Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them slip from your heart as long as you live."
DEU	4	9	Moses	#01		6286	 Teach them to your children and to their children after them.
DEU	4	10	Moses	#01		6287	" {10} Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, when he said to me,"
DEU	4	10	God-FX1	#20		6288	 << Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children.>>
DEU	4	11	Moses	#01		6289	" {11} You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness."
DEU	4	12	Moses	#01		6290	 {12} Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.
DEU	4	13	Moses	#01		6291	" {13} He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets."
DEU	4	14	Moses	#01		6292	 {14} And the Lord directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
DEU	4	15	Moses	#01		6293	 {15} You saw no form of any kind the day the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire.
DEU	4	15	Moses	#01		6294	" Therefore watch yourselves very carefully, {16} so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman,"
DEU	4	17	Moses	#01		6295	" {17} or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air, {18} or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below."
DEU	4	19	Moses	#01		6296	" {19} And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars--all the heavenly array--do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the Lord your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven."
DEU	4	20	Moses	#01		6297	" {20} But as for you, the Lord took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of his inheritance, as you now are."
DEU	4	21	Moses	#01		6298	" {21} The Lord was angry with me because of you, and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance."
DEU	4	22	Moses	#01		6299	 {22} I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land.
DEU	4	23	Moses	#01		6300	 {23} Be careful not to forget the covenant of the Lord your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the Lord your God has forbidden.
DEU	4	24	Moses	#01		6301	" {24} For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God."
DEU	4	25	Moses	#01		6302	 {25} After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time--
DEU	4	25	Moses	#01		6303	" if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil in the eyes of the Lord your God and provoking him to anger,"
DEU	4	26	Moses	#01		6304	 {26} I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
DEU	4	26	Moses	#01		6305	 You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed.
DEU	4	27	Moses	#01		6306	" {27} The Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the Lord will drive you."
DEU	4	28	Moses	#01		6307	" {28} There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell."
DEU	4	29	Moses	#01		6308	" {29} But if from there you seek the Lord your God, you will find him if you look for him with all your heart and with all your soul."
DEU	4	30	Moses	#01		6309	" {30} When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the Lord your God and obey him."
DEU	4	31	Moses	#01		6310	" {31} For the Lord your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your forefathers, which he confirmed to them by oath."
DEU	4	32	Moses	#01		6311	" {32} Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created man on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other."
DEU	4	32	Moses	#01		6312	" Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of?"
DEU	4	33	Moses	#01		6313	" {33} Has any other people heard the voice of God speaking out of fire, as you have, and lived?"
DEU	4	34	Moses	#01		6314	" {34} Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation, by testings, by miraculous signs and wonders, "
DEU	4	34	Moses	#01		6315	" by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?"
DEU	4	35	Moses	#01		6316	 {35} You were shown these things so that you might know that the Lord is God; besides him there is no other.
DEU	4	36	Moses	#01		6317	" {36} From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire."
DEU	4	37	Moses	#01		6318	" {37} Because he loved your forefathers and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength,"
DEU	4	38	Moses	#01		6319	" {38} to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today."
DEU	4	39	Moses	#01		6320	 {39} Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the Lord is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other.
DEU	4	40	Moses	#01		6321	" {40} Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the Lord your God gives you for all time."
DEU	4	41	Narr_05: Deuteronomy	#19		6322	" {41} Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan, {42} to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if he had unintentionally killed his neighbor without malice aforethought."

DEU	5	4	Moses	#01		6335	 {4} The Lord spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain.
DEU	5	5	Moses	#01		6336	" {5} (At that time I stood between the Lord and you to declare to you the word of the Lord, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain.) And he said:"

DEU	5	11	God-FX1	#20		6341	" {11} öYou shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name."

DEU	7	18	Moses	#01		6410	 {18} But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.
DEU	7	19	Moses	#01		6411	" {19} You saw with your own eyes the great trials, the miraculous signs and wonders, the mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the Lord your God brought you out."
DEU	7	19	Moses	#01		6412	 The Lord your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear.

DEU	7	21	Moses	#01		6414	" {21} Do not be terrified by them, for the Lord your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God."
DEU	7	22	Moses	#01		6415	" {22} The Lord your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little. You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will multiply around you."
DEU	7	23	Moses	#01		6416	" {23} But the Lord your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed."
DEU	7	24	Moses	#01		6417	" {24} He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand up against you; you will destroy them."
DEU	7	25	Moses	#01		6418	 {25} The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire.
DEU	7	25	Moses	#01		6419	" Do not covet the silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the Lord your God."

DEU	9	2	Moses	#01		6445	 {2} The people are strong and tall--Anakites! You know about them and have heard it said:
DEU	9	2	Man	#12		6446	 << Who can stand up against the Anakites?>>
DEU	9	3	Moses	#01		6447	 {3} But be assured today that the Lord your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire.
DEU	9	3	Moses	#01		6448	" He will destroy them; he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly, as the Lord has promised you."
DEU	9	4	Moses	#01		6449	" {4} After the Lord your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself,"
DEU	9	4	Israelite	#09		6450	 << The Lord has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness.>>
DEU	9	4	Moses	#01		6451	" No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is going to drive them out before you."
DEU	9	5	Moses	#01		6452	 {5} It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land;
DEU	9	5	Moses	#01		6453	" but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the Lord your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
DEU	9	6	Moses	#01		6454	" {6} Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the Lord your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people."
DEU	9	7	Moses	#01		6455	 {7} Remember this and never forget how you provoked the Lord your God to anger in the desert.
DEU	9	7	Moses	#01		6456	" From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the Lord."
DEU	9	8	Moses	#01		6457	 {8} At Horeb you aroused the Lord's wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you.
DEU	9	9	Moses	#01		6458	" {9} When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the Lord had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights;"
DEU	9	9	Moses	#01		6459	 I ate no bread and drank no water.
DEU	9	10	Moses	#01		6460	" {10} The Lord gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the Lord proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly."
DEU	9	11	Moses	#01		6461	" {11} At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the Lord gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant. {12} Then the Lord told me,"
DEU	9	12	God-FX1	#20		6462	" << Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt."

DEU	9	13	Moses	#01		6464	" {13} And the Lord said to me,"
DEU	9	13	God-FX1	#20		6465	" << I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed!"
DEU	9	14	God-FX1	#20		6466	" {14} Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.>>"
DEU	9	15	Moses	#01		6467	 {15} So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands.
DEU	9	16	Moses	#01		6468	" {16} When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf."
DEU	9	16	Moses	#01		6469	 You had turned aside quickly from the way that the Lord had commanded you.
DEU	9	17	Moses	#01		6470	" {17} So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes."
DEU	9	18	Moses	#01		6471	 {18} Then once again I fell prostrate before the Lord for forty days and forty nights;
DEU	9	18	Moses	#01		6472	" I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the Lord's sight and so provoking him to anger."
DEU	9	19	Moses	#01		6473	" {19} I feared the anger and wrath of the Lord, for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again the Lord listened to me."
DEU	9	20	Moses	#01		6474	" {20} And the Lord was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too."
DEU	9	21	Moses	#01		6475	" {21} Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire."
DEU	9	21	Moses	#01		6476	 Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.
DEU	9	22	Moses	#01		6477	" {22} You also made the Lord angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah."
DEU	9	23	Moses	#01		6478	" {23} And when the Lord sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said,"
DEU	9	23	God-FX1	#20		6479	 << Go up and take possession of the land I have given you.>>
DEU	9	23	Moses	#01		6480	 But you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God. You did not trust him or obey him. {24} You have been rebellious against the Lord ever since I have known you.
DEU	9	25	Moses	#01		6481	 {25} I lay prostrate before the Lord those forty days and forty nights because the Lord had said he would destroy you.
DEU	9	26	Moses	#01		6482	" {26} I prayed to the Lord and said, ôO Sovereign Lord, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand."
DEU	9	27	Moses	#01		6483	" {27} Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin."
DEU	9	28	Moses	#01		6484	" {28} Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, 'Because the Lord was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the desert.'"

DEU	10	3	Moses	#01		6490	" {3} So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands."
DEU	10	4	Moses	#01		6491	" {4} The Lord wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the Lord gave them to me."
DEU	10	5	Moses	#01		6492	" {5} Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the Lord commanded me, and they are there now."

DEU	23	4	Moses	#01		6853	" {4} For they did not come to meet you with bread and water on your way when you came out of Egypt, and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Naharaim to pronounce a curse on you."
DEU	23	5	Moses	#01		6854	" {5} However, the Lord your God would not listen to Balaam but turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the Lord your God loves you."
DEU	23	6	Moses	#01		6855	 {6} Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them as long as you live.

DEU	23	13	Moses	#01		6862	" {13} As part of your equipment have something to dig with, and when you relieve yourself, dig a hole and cover up your excrement."
DEU	23	14	Moses	#01		6863	 {14} For the Lord your God moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you.
DEU	23	14	Moses	#01		6864	" Your camp must be holy, so that he will not see among you anything indecent and turn away from you."

DEU	23	21	Moses	#01		6871	" {21} If you make a vow to the Lord your God, do not be slow to pay it, for the Lord your God will certainly demand it of you and you will be guilty of sin."
DEU	23	22	Moses	#01		6872	" {22} But if you refrain from making a vow, you will not be guilty."
DEU	23	23	Moses	#01		6873	" {23} Whatever your lips utter you must be sure to do, because you made your vow freely to the Lord your God with your own mouth."
DEU	23	24	Moses	#01		6874	" {24} If you enter your neighbor's vineyard, you may eat all the grapes you want, but do not put any in your basket."

DEU	28	14	Moses	#01		7013	" {14} Do not turn aside from any of the commands I give you today, to the right or to the left, following other gods and serving them."
DEU	28	15	Moses	#01		7014	" {15} However, if you do not obey the Lord your God and do not carefully follow all his commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come upon you and overtake you:"
DEU	28	16	Moses	#01		7015	 {16} You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country. {17} Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed.
DEU	28	18	Moses	#01		7016	" {18} The fruit of your womb will be cursed, and the crops of your land, and the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks."
DEU	28	19	Moses	#01		7017	 {19} You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.
DEU	28	20	Moses	#01		7018	" {20} The Lord will send on you curses, confusion and rebuke in everything you put your hand to, until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him."
DEU	28	21	Moses	#01		7019	 {21} The Lord will plague you with diseases until he has destroyed you from the land you are entering to possess.
DEU	28	22	Moses	#01		7020	" {22} The Lord will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, with blight and mildew, which will plague you until you perish."

DEU	28	25	Moses	#01		7023	 {25} The Lord will cause you to be defeated before your enemies.
DEU	28	25	Moses	#01		7024	" You will come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven, and you will become a thing of horror to all the kingdoms on earth."
DEU	28	26	Moses	#01		7025	" {26} Your carcasses will be food for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and there will be no one to frighten them away."
DEU	28	27	Moses	#01		7026	" {27} The Lord will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, festering sores and the itch, from which you cannot be cured."
DEU	28	28	Moses	#01		7027	" {28} The Lord will afflict you with madness, blindness and confusion of mind."
DEU	28	29	Moses	#01		7028	" {29} At midday you will grope about like a blind man in the dark. You will be unsuccessful in everything you do; day after day you will be oppressed and robbed, with no one to rescue you."
DEU	28	30	Moses	#01		7029	" {30} You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and ravish her."
DEU	28	30	Moses	#01		7030	" You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit."
DEU	28	31	Moses	#01		7031	" {31} Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it."
DEU	28	31	Moses	#01		7032	" Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will rescue them."
DEU	28	32	Moses	#01		7033	" {32} Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and you will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day, powerless to lift a hand."
DEU	28	33	Moses	#01		7034	" {33} A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days."
DEU	28	34	Moses	#01		7035	 {34} The sights you see will drive you mad.
DEU	28	35	Moses	#01		7036	" {35} The Lord will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head."
DEU	28	36	Moses	#01		7037	" {36} The Lord will drive you and the king you set over you to a nation unknown to you or your fathers. There you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone."
DEU	28	37	Moses	#01		7038	 {37} You will become a thing of horror and an object of scorn and ridicule to all the nations where the Lord will drive you.
DEU	28	38	Moses	#01		7039	" {38} You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it."
DEU	28	39	Moses	#01		7040	" {39} You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them."
DEU	28	40	Moses	#01		7041	" {40} You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil, because the olives will drop off."
DEU	28	41	Moses	#01		7042	" {41} You will have sons and daughters but you will not keep them, because they will go into captivity."
DEU	28	42	Moses	#01		7043	 {42} Swarms of locusts will take over all your trees and the crops of your land.
DEU	28	43	Moses	#01		7044	" {43} The alien who lives among you will rise above you higher and higher, but you will sink lower and lower."
DEU	28	44	Moses	#01		7045	" {44} He will lend to you, but you will not lend to him. He will be the head, but you will be the tail."
DEU	28	45	Moses	#01		7046	 {45} All these curses will come upon you.
DEU	28	45	Moses	#01		7047	" They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the Lord your God and observe the commands and decrees he gave you."
DEU	28	46	Moses	#01		7048	 {46} They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants forever.
DEU	28	47	Moses	#01		7049	" {47} Because you did not serve the Lord your God joyfully and gladly in the time of prosperity, {48} therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will serve the enemies the Lord sends against you."
DEU	28	48	Moses	#01		7050	 He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you.
DEU	28	49	Moses	#01		7051	" {49} The Lord will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language you will not understand,"
DEU	28	50	Moses	#01		7052	 {50} a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young.
DEU	28	51	Moses	#01		7053	 {51} They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed.
DEU	28	51	Moses	#01		7054	" They will leave you no grain, new wine or oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined."
DEU	28	52	Moses	#01		7055	 {52} They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down.
DEU	28	52	Moses	#01		7056	 They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the Lord your God is giving you.
DEU	28	53	Moses	#01		7057	" {53} Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the Lord your God has given you."
DEU	28	54	Moses	#01		7058	" {54} Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children,"
DEU	28	55	Moses	#01		7059	 {55} and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating.
DEU	28	55	Moses	#01		7060	 It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities.
DEU	28	56	Moses	#01		7061	 {56} The most gentle and sensitive woman among you--so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot--
DEU	28	56	Moses	#01		7062	 will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter {57} the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears.
DEU	28	57	Moses	#01		7063	 For she intends to eat them secretly during the siege and in the distress that your enemy will inflict on you in your cities.
DEU	28	58	Moses	#01		7064	" {58} If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name--the Lord your God--"
DEU	28	59	Moses	#01		7065	" {59} the Lord will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses."
DEU	28	60	Moses	#01		7066	" {60} He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you."
DEU	28	61	Moses	#01		7067	" {61} The Lord will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed."
DEU	28	62	Moses	#01		7068	" {62} You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the Lord your God."
DEU	28	63	Moses	#01		7069	" {63} Just as it pleased the Lord to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess."
DEU	28	64	Moses	#01		7070	" {64} Then the Lord will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other."
DEU	28	64	Moses	#01		7071	" There you will worship other gods--gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known."
DEU	28	65	Moses	#01		7072	" {65} Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot."
DEU	28	65	Moses	#01		7073	" There the Lord will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart."
DEU	28	66	Moses	#01		7074	" {66} You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life."
DEU	28	67	Moses	#01		7075	" {67} In the morning you will say,"
DEU	28	67	Israelite	#14		7076	 << If only it were evening!>>
DEU	28	67	Moses	#01		7077	" and in the evening,"
DEU	28	67	Israelite	#14		7078	 << If only it were morning!>>
DEU	28	67	Moses	#01		7079	 --because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see.
DEU	28	68	Moses	#01		7080	 {68} The Lord will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again.

DEU	29	1	Narr_05: Deuteronomy	#19		7083	" {1} These are the terms of the covenant the Lord commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Horeb."
DEU	29	2	Narr_05: Deuteronomy	#19		7084	 {2} Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them:
DEU	29	2	Moses	#01		7085	" Your eyes have seen all that the Lord did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials and to all his land."
DEU	29	3	Moses	#01		7086	" {3} With your own eyes you saw those great trials, those miraculous signs and great wonders."
DEU	29	4	Moses	#01		7087	 {4} But to this day the Lord has not given you a mind that understands or eyes that see or ears that hear.
DEU	29	5	God-FX1	#20		7088	" {5} During the forty years that I led you through the desert, your clothes did not wear out, nor did the sandals on your feet."
DEU	29	6	God-FX1	#20		7089	 {6} You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the Lord your God.
DEU	29	7	Moses	#01		7090	" {7} When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to fight against us, but we defeated them."
DEU	29	8	Moses	#01		7091	" {8} We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh."
DEU	29	9	Moses	#01		7092	" {9} Carefully follow the terms of this covenant, so that you may prosper in everything you do."
DEU	29	10	Moses	#01		7093	" {10} All of you are standing today in the presence of the Lord your God--your leaders and chief men, your elders and officials, and all the other men of Israel,"
DEU	29	11	Moses	#01		7094	" {11} together with your children and your wives, and the aliens living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water."
DEU	29	12	Moses	#01		7095	" {12} You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the Lord your God, a covenant the Lord is making with you this day and sealing with an oath,"
DEU	29	13	Moses	#01		7096	" {13} to confirm you this day as his people, that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
DEU	29	14	Moses	#01		7097	" {14} I am making this covenant, with its oath, not only with you {15} who are standing here with us today in the presence of the Lord our God but also with those who are not here today."
DEU	29	16	Moses	#01		7098	 {16} You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here.
DEU	29	17	Moses	#01		7099	" {17} You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold."
DEU	29	18	Moses	#01		7100	" {18} Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the Lord our God to go and worship the gods of those nations;"
DEU	29	18	Moses	#01		7101	 make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison.
DEU	29	19	Moses	#01		7102	" {19} When such a person hears the words of this oath, he invokes a blessing on himself and therefore thinks,"
DEU	29	19	Man	#04		7103	" << I will be safe, even though I persist in going my own way.>>"
DEU	29	19	Moses	#01		7104	 This will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry.
DEU	29	20	Moses	#01		7105	 {20} The Lord will never be willing to forgive him; his wrath and zeal will burn against that man.
DEU	29	20	Moses	#01		7106	" All the curses written in this book will fall upon him, and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven."
DEU	29	21	Moses	#01		7107	" {21} The Lord will single him out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law."
DEU	29	22	Moses	#01		7108	 {22} Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the Lord has afflicted it.
DEU	29	23	Moses	#01		7109	" {23} The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur--nothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it."
DEU	29	23	Moses	#01		7110	" It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the Lord overthrew in fierce anger. {24} All the nations will ask:"
DEU	29	24	Man	#16		7111	" << Why has the Lord done this to this land? Why this fierce, burning anger?>>"
DEU	29	25	Moses	#01		7112	 {25} And the answer will be:
DEU	29	25	Man	#09		7113	" << It is because this people abandoned the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers, the covenant he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt."
DEU	29	26	Man	#09		7114	" {26} They went off and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, gods they did not know, gods he had not given them."
DEU	29	27	Man	#09		7115	" {27} Therefore the Lord's anger burned against this land, so that he brought on it all the curses written in this book."
DEU	29	28	Man	#09		7116	" {28} In furious anger and in great wrath the Lord uprooted them from their land and thrust them into another land, as it is now.>>"

DEU	32	5	Moses	#01		7187	" {5} They have acted corruptly toward him; to their shame they are no longer his children, but a warped and crooked generation."
DEU	32	6	Moses	#01		7188	" {6} Is this the way you repay the Lord, O foolish and unwise people? Is he not your Father, your Creator, who made you and formed you?"
DEU	32	7	Moses	#01		7189	" {7} Remember the days of old; consider the generations long past. Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders, and they will explain to you."
DEU	32	8	Moses	#01		7190	" {8} When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided all mankind, he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel."

DEU	32	43	Moses	#01		7229	" {43} Rejoice, O nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants; he will take vengeance on his enemies and make atonement for his land and people."
DEU	32	44	Narr_05: Deuteronomy	#19		7230	 {44} Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.

DEU	32	51	God-FX1	#20		7237	 {51} This is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin and because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites.

JOS	7	4	Narr_06: Joshua	#09		7481	" {4} So about three thousand men went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai, {5} who killed about thirty-six of them."
JOS	7	5	Narr_06: Joshua	#09		7482	 They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted and became like water.

JOS	7	12	God-FX1	#20		7494	 {12} That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction.

JOS	8	11	Narr_06: Joshua	#09		7532	" {11} The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the city."
JOS	8	12	Narr_06: Joshua	#09		7533	" {12} Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city."
JOS	8	13	Narr_06: Joshua	#09		7534	 {13} They had the soldiers take up their positions--all those in the camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley.

1SM	3	2	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9421	" {2} One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place."
1SM	3	3	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9422	" {3} The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was."
1SM	3	4	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9423	" {4} Then the Lord called Samuel. Samuel answered,"
1SM	3	4	Samuel (boy)	#18		9424	 << Here I am.>>
1SM	3	5	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9425	" {5} And he ran to Eli and said,"
1SM	3	5	Samuel (boy)	#18		9426	 << Here I am; you called me.>>
1SM	3	5	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9427	" But Eli said,"
1SM	3	5	Eli (very old)	#02		9428	 << I did not call; go back and lie down.>>
1SM	3	5	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9429	" So he went and lay down. {6} Again the Lord called,"
1SM	3	6	God-FX1	#20		9430	 << Samuel!>>
1SM	3	6	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9431	" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said,"
1SM	3	6	Samuel (boy)	#18		9432	 << Here I am; you called me.>>
1SM	3	6	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9433	" Eli said,"
1SM	3	6	Eli (very old)	#02		9434	" << My son, I did not call; go back and lie down.>>"
1SM	3	7	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9435	 {7} Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord: The word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him.
1SM	3	8	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9436	" {8} The Lord called Samuel a third time, and Samuel got up and went to Eli and said,"
1SM	3	8	Samuel (boy)	#18		9437	 << Here I am; you called me.>>
1SM	3	8	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9438	" Then Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy. {9} So Eli told Samuel,"
1SM	3	9	Eli (very old)	#02		9439	" << Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, 'Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.'>>"
1SM	3	9	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9440	" So Samuel went and lay down in his place. {10} The Lord came and stood there, calling as at the other times,"
1SM	3	10	God-FX1	#20		9441	 << Samuel! Samuel!>>
1SM	3	10	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9442	" Then Samuel said,"
1SM	3	10	Samuel (boy)	#18		9443	" << Speak, for your servant is listening.>>"
1SM	3	11	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9444	 {11} And the Lord said to Samuel:
1SM	3	11	God-FX1	#20		9445	" << See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle."
1SM	3	12	God-FX1	#20		9446	 {12} At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family--from beginning to end.
1SM	3	13	God-FX1	#20		9447	" {13} For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons made themselves contemptible, and he failed to restrain them."
1SM	3	14	God-FX1	#20		9448	" {14} Therefore, I swore to the house of Eli, 'The guilt of Eli's house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.Æ>>"
1SM	3	15	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9449	" {15} Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the Lord. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision, {16} but Eli called him and said,"
1SM	3	16	Eli (very old)	#02		9450	" << Samuel, my son.>>"
1SM	3	16	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9451	" Samuel answered,"
1SM	3	16	Samuel (boy)	#18		9452	 << Here I am.>>
1SM	3	17	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9453	" {17} Eli asked,"
1SM	3	17	Eli (very old)	#02		9454	 << What was it he said to you? Do not hide it from me.
1SM	3	17	Eli (very old)	#02		9455	" May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you.>>"
1SM	3	18	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9456	" {18} So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said,"
1SM	3	18	Eli (very old)	#02		9457	 << He is the Lord; let him do what is good in his eyes.>>
1SM	3	19	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9458	" {19} The Lord was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of his words fall to the ground."
1SM	3	20	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9459	 {20} And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the Lord.
1SM	3	21	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9460	" {21} The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word. *~**~*||||| + 2 SECs |||||*~*"

1SM	4	2	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9463	" {2} The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield."
1SM	4	3	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9464	" {3} When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked,"
1SM	4	3	Elder	#15		9465	 << Why did the Lord bring defeat upon us today before the Philistines?
1SM	4	3	Elder	#15		9466	" Let us bring the ark of the Lord's covenant from Shiloh, so that it may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies.>>"

1SM	4	4	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9468	" And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God."
1SM	4	5	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9469	" {5} When the ark of the Lord's covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook. {6} Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked,"

1SM	4	6	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9471	" When they learned that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp, {7} the Philistines were afraid. They said,"

1SM	4	7	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9473	" and,"

1SM	4	8	Philistine	#04		9476	 They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the desert.

1SM	4	10	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9478	" {10} So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers."
1SM	4	11	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9479	" {11} The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died."
1SM	4	12	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9480	" {12} That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh, his clothes torn and dust on his head."
1SM	4	13	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9481	" {13} When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God."

1SM	5	2	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9504	 {2} Then they carried the ark into Dagon's temple and set it beside Dagon.
1SM	5	3	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9505	" {3} When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! They took Dagon and put him back in his place."
1SM	5	4	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9506	" {4} But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord!"
1SM	5	4	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9507	 His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained.
1SM	5	5	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9508	 {5} That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon's temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.
1SM	5	6	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9509	 {6} The Lord's hand was heavy upon the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation upon them and afflicted them with tumors.
1SM	5	7	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9510	" {7} When the men of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said,"
1SM	5	7	Man of Ashdod	#08		9511	" << The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god.>>"
1SM	5	8	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9512	" {8} So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them,"

1SM	5	8	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9514	" They answered,"
1SM	5	8	Philistine Ruler	#17		9515	 << Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath.>>
1SM	5	8	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9516	 So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.
1SM	5	9	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9517	" {9} But after they had moved it, the Lord's hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors."
1SM	5	10	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9518	" {10} So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out,"

1SM	5	11	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9522	 For death had filled the city with panic; God's hand was very heavy upon it.

1SM	6	1	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9525	" {1} When the ark of the Lord had been in Philistine territory seven months, {2} the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said,"
1SM	6	2	Philistine	#06		9526	 << What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? Tell us how we should send it back to its place.>>
1SM	6	3	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9527	" {3} They answered,"

1SM	6	4	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9530	" {4} The Philistines asked,"
1SM	6	4	Philistine	#04		9531	 << What guilt offering should we send to him?>>
1SM	6	4	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9532	" They replied,"
1SM	6	4	Fortune Teller	#21		9533	" << Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers."
1SM	6	5	Fortune Teller	#21		9534	" {5} Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and pay honor to Israel's god."
1SM	6	5	Fortune Teller	#21		9535	 Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land.
1SM	6	6	Fortune Teller	#21		9536	 {6} Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did?
1SM	6	6	Fortune Teller	#21		9537	" When he treated them harshly, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way?"
1SM	6	7	Fortune Teller	#21		9538	" {7} << Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked."
1SM	6	7	Fortune Teller	#21		9539	" Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up."
1SM	6	8	Fortune Teller	#21		9540	" {8} Take the ark of the Lord and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering."
1SM	6	8	Fortune Teller	#21		9541	" Send it on its way, {9} but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then the Lord has brought this great disaster on us."
1SM	6	9	Fortune Teller	#21		9542	" But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us and that it happened to us us by chance.>>"
1SM	6	10	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9543	 {10} So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves.
1SM	6	11	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9544	 {11} They placed the ark of the Lord on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors.
1SM	6	12	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9545	" {12} Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left."
1SM	6	12	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9546	 The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.
1SM	6	13	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9547	" {13} Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight."

1SM	6	18	Narr_09: 1_Samuel	#01		9554	 {18} And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers--the fortified towns with their country villages.

1KI	7	23	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12150	" {23} He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it."
1KI	7	24	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12151	" {24} Below the rim, gourds encircled it--ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea."
1KI	7	25	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12152	" {25} The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east."
1KI	7	25	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12153	" The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center."
1KI	7	26	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12154	" {26} It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths."
1KI	7	27	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12155	" {27} He also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long, four wide and three high."
1KI	7	28	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12156	 {28} This is how the stands were made: They had side panels attached to uprights.
1KI	7	29	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12157	" {29} On the panels between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim --and on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work."
1KI	7	30	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12158	" {30} Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast with wreaths on each side."
1KI	7	31	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12159	 {31} On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit deep.
1KI	7	31	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12160	" This opening was round, and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half. Around its opening there was engraving. The panels of the stands were square, not round."
1KI	7	32	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12161	" {32} The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half."
1KI	7	33	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12162	" {33} The wheels were made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all of cast metal."
1KI	7	34	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12163	" {34} Each stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the stand."
1KI	7	35	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12164	 {35} At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand.
1KI	7	36	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12165	" {36} He engraved cherubim, lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels, in every available space, with wreaths all around."
1KI	7	37	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12166	 {37} This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape.
1KI	7	38	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12167	" {38} He then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths and measuring four cubits across, one basin to go on each of the ten stands."
1KI	7	39	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12168	" {39} He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple."
1KI	7	40	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12169	 {40} He also made the basins and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished all the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of the Lord:
1KI	7	41	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12170	 {41} the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;
1KI	7	42	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12171	" {42} the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);"
1KI	7	43	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12172	 {43} the ten stands with their ten basins; {44} the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;
1KI	7	45	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12173	" {45} the pots, shovels and sprinkling bowls. All these objects that Huram made for King Solomon for the temple of the Lord were of burnished bronze."
1KI	7	46	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12174	 {46} The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan.
1KI	7	47	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12175	" {47} Solomon left all these things unweighed, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined."
1KI	7	48	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12176	 {48} Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the Lord's temple: the golden altar; the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence;
1KI	7	49	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12177	" {49} the lampstands of pure gold (five on the right and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary); the gold floral work and lamps and tongs;"
1KI	7	50	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12178	" {50} the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers;"
1KI	7	50	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12179	" and the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room, the Most Holy Place, and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple."
1KI	7	51	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12180	" {51} When all the work King Solomon had done for the temple of the Lord was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated--"

1KI	8	2	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12184	" {2} All the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the time of the festival in the month of Ethanim, the seventh month."
1KI	8	3	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12185	" {3} When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark, {4} and they brought up the ark of the Lord and the Tent of Meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it."
1KI	8	4	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12186	" The priests and Levites carried them up, {5} and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted."
1KI	8	6	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12187	" {6} The priests then brought the ark of the Lord's covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim."
1KI	8	7	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12188	 {7} The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its carrying poles.
1KI	8	8	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12189	" {8} These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today."
1KI	8	9	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12190	" {9} There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt."
1KI	8	10	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12191	" {10} When the priests withdrew from the Holy Place, the cloud filled the temple of the Lord."
1KI	8	11	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12192	" {11} And the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord filled his temple. {12} Then Solomon said,"

1KI	8	13	Solomon	#10		12194	" {13} I have indeed built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever.>>"
1KI	8	14	Narr_11: 1_Kings	#11		12195	" {14} While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them. {15} Then he said:"
1KI	8	15	Solomon	#10		12196	" << Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who with his own hand has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father David. For he said,"
1KI	8	16	Solomon	#10		12197	" {16} 'Since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built for my Name to be there, but I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.' <<"
1KI	8	17	Solomon	#10		12198	" {17} My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel."
1KI	8	18	Solomon	#10		12199	" {18} But the Lord said to my father David, 'Because it was in your heart to build a temple for my Name, you did well to have this in your heart."
1KI	8	19	Solomon	#10		12200	" {19} Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, who is your own flesh and blood--he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.' <<"
1KI	8	20	Solomon	#10		12201	 {20} The Lord has kept the promise he made:

1KI	8	50	Solomon	#10		12237	" {50} And forgive your people, who have sinned against you; forgive all the offenses they have committed against you, and cause their conquerors to show them mercy;"
1KI	8	51	Solomon	#10		12238	" {51} for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of Egypt, out of that iron-smelting furnace."

2CH	22	1	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16022	 So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
2CH	22	2	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16023	" {2} Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri."
2CH	22	3	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16024	" {3} He too walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother encouraged him in doing wrong."
2CH	22	4	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16025	" {4} He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as the house of Ahab had done, for after his father's death they became his advisers, to his undoing."
2CH	22	5	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16026	 {5} He also followed their counsel when he went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;
2CH	22	6	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16027	 {6} so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on him at Ramoth in his battle with Hazael king of Aram.
2CH	22	6	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16028	 Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab because he had been wounded.
2CH	22	7	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16029	" {7} Through Ahaziah's visit to Joram, God brought about Ahaziah's downfall."
2CH	22	7	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16030	" When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab."
2CH	22	8	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16031	" {8} While Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's relatives, who had been attending Ahaziah, and he killed them."
2CH	22	9	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16032	" {9} He then went in search of Ahaziah, and his men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. He was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said,"
2CH	22	9	Man	#14		16033	" << He was a son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart.>>"
2CH	22	9	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16034	 So there was no one in the house of Ahaziah powerful enough to retain the kingdom.
2CH	22	10	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16035	" {10} When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family of the house of Judah."
2CH	22	11	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16036	" {11} But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes who were about to be murdered and put him and his nurse in a bedroom."
2CH	22	11	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16037	" Because Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of the priest Jehoiada, was Ahaziah's sister, she hid the child from Athaliah so she could not kill him."
2CH	22	12	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16038	 {12} He remained hidden with them at the temple of God for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.*~**~*||||| + 2 SECs |||||*~*

2CH	23	1	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16040	 {1} In the seventh year Jehoiada showed his strength. He made a covenant with the commanders of units of a hundred:
2CH	23	1	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16041	" Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zicri."
2CH	23	2	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16042	 {2} They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites and the heads of Israelite families from all the towns.
2CH	23	2	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16043	" When they came to Jerusalem, {3} the whole assembly made a covenant with the king at the temple of God. Jehoiada said to them,"
2CH	23	3	Priest: Jehoiada	#01		16044	" << The king's son shall reign, as the Lord promised concerning the descendants of David."
2CH	23	4	Priest: Jehoiada	#01		16045	 {4} Now this is what you are to do:
2CH	23	4	Priest: Jehoiada	#01		16046	" A third of you priests and Levites who are going on duty on the Sabbath are to keep watch at the doors,"
2CH	23	4	Priest: Jehoiada	#01		16047	 a third of you at the royal palace and {5} a third at the Foundation Gate.
2CH	23	5	Priest: Jehoiada	#01		16048	 And all the other men are to be in the courtyards of the temple of the Lord.
2CH	23	6	Priest: Jehoiada	#01		16049	 {6} No one is to enter the temple of the Lord except the priests and Levites on duty;
2CH	23	6	Priest: Jehoiada	#01		16050	" they may enter because they are consecrated, but all the other men are to guard what the Lord has assigned to them."
2CH	23	7	Priest: Jehoiada	#01		16051	" {7} The Levites are to station themselves around the king, each man with his weapons in his hand."
2CH	23	7	Priest: Jehoiada	#01		16052	 Anyone who enters the temple must be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes.>>
2CH	23	8	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16053	 {8} The Levites and all the men of Judah did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered.
2CH	23	8	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16054	 Each one took his men--those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty--for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions.
2CH	23	9	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16055	 {9} Then he gave the commanders of units of a hundred the spears and the large and small shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of God.
2CH	23	10	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16056	" {10} He stationed all the men, each with his weapon in his hand, around the king--near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple."
2CH	23	11	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16057	" {11} Jehoiada and his sons brought out the king's son and put the crown on him; they presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him and shouted,"
2CH	23	11	Man in Crowd	#18		16058	 << Long live the king!>>
2CH	23	12	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16059	" {12} When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the king, she went to them at the temple of the Lord."
2CH	23	13	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16060	" {13} She looked, and there was the king, standing by his pillar at the entrance."
2CH	23	13	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16061	" The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and singers with musical instruments were leading the praises."
2CH	23	13	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16062	" Then Athaliah tore her robes and shouted,"
2CH	23	13	Athaliah (female)	#24		16063	 << Treason! Treason!>>
2CH	23	14	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16064	" {14} Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops, and said to them:"
2CH	23	14	Priest: Jehoiada	#01		16065	 << Bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her.>>
2CH	23	14	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16066	" For the priest had said,"
2CH	23	14	Priest: Jehoiada	#01		16067	 << Do not put her to death at the temple of the Lord.>>
2CH	23	15	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16068	" {15} So they seized her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, and there they put her to death."
2CH	23	16	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16069	 {16} Jehoiada then made a covenant that he and the people and the king would be the Lord's people.
2CH	23	17	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16070	 {17} All the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
2CH	23	18	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16071	" {18} Then Jehoiada placed the oversight of the temple of the Lord in the hands of the priests, who were Levites,"
2CH	23	18	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16072	" to whom David had made assignments in the temple, to present the burnt offerings of the Lord as written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and singing, as David had ordered."
2CH	23	19	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16073	 {19} He also stationed doorkeepers at the gates of the Lord's temple so that no one who was in any way unclean might enter.
2CH	23	20	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16074	" {20} He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the temple of the Lord."
2CH	23	20	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16075	" They went into the palace through the Upper Gate and seated the king on the royal throne, {21} and all the people of the land rejoiced."

2CH	24	1	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16078	" {1} Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother's name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba."
2CH	24	2	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16079	" {2} Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all the years of Jehoiada the priest. {3} Jehoiada chose two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters."
2CH	24	4	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16080	" {4} Some time later Joash decided to restore the temple of the Lord. {5} He called together the priests and Levites and said to them,"
2CH	24	5	King Joash	#12		16081	" << Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel, to repair the temple of your God. Do it now.>>"
2CH	24	5	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16082	" But the Levites did not act at once. {6} Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him,"
2CH	24	6	King Joash	#12		16083	 << Why haven't you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the Lord and by the assembly of Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?>>
2CH	24	7	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16084	 {7} Now the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the temple of God and had used even its sacred objects for the Baals.
2CH	24	8	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16085	" {8} At the king's command, a chest was made and placed outside, at the gate of the temple of the Lord."
2CH	24	9	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16086	 {9} A proclamation was then issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they should bring to the Lord the tax that Moses the servant of God had required of Israel in the desert.
2CH	24	10	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16087	" {10} All the officials and all the people brought their contributions gladly, dropping them into the chest until it was full."
2CH	24	11	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16088	" {11} Whenever the chest was brought in by the Levites to the king's officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money,"
2CH	24	11	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16089	 the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place.
2CH	24	11	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16090	 They did this regularly and collected a great amount of money.
2CH	24	12	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16091	 {12} The king and Jehoiada gave it to the men who carried out the work required for the temple of the Lord.
2CH	24	12	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16092	" They hired masons and carpenters to restore the Lord's temple, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the temple."
2CH	24	13	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16093	" {13} The men in charge of the work were diligent, and the repairs progressed under them. They rebuilt the temple of God according to its original design and reinforced it."
2CH	24	14	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16094	" {14} When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made articles for the Lord's temple:"
2CH	24	14	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16095	" articles for the service and for the burnt offerings, and also dishes and other objects of gold and silver."
2CH	24	14	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16096	" As long as Jehoiada lived, burnt offerings were presented continually in the temple of the Lord."
2CH	24	15	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16097	" {15} Now Jehoiada was old and full of years, and he died at the age of a hundred and thirty."
2CH	24	16	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16098	" {16} He was buried with the kings in the City of David, because of the good he had done in Israel for God and his temple."
2CH	24	17	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16099	" {17} After the death of Jehoiada, the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and he listened to them."
2CH	24	18	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16100	" {18} They abandoned the temple of the Lord, the God of their fathers, and worshiped Asherah poles and idols. Because of their guilt, God's anger came upon Judah and Jerusalem."
2CH	24	19	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16101	" {19} Although the Lord sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him, and though they testified against them, they would not listen."
2CH	24	20	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16102	" {20} Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and said,"

2CH	24	21	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16105	" {21} But they plotted against him, and by order of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the Lord's temple."
2CH	24	22	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16106	" {22} King Joash did not remember the kindness Zechariah's father Jehoiada had shown him but killed his son, who said as he lay dying,"
2CH	24	22	Zechariah (son of Jehoiada)	#06		16107	 << May the Lord see this and call you to account.>>
2CH	24	23	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16108	" {23} At the turn of the year, the army of Aram marched against Joash; it invaded Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the leaders of the people."
2CH	24	23	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16109	 They sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus.
2CH	24	24	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16110	" {24} Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men, the Lord delivered into their hands a much larger army."
2CH	24	24	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16111	" Because Judah had forsaken the Lord, the God of their fathers, judgment was executed on Joash."
2CH	24	25	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16112	" {25} When the Arameans withdrew, they left Joash severely wounded. His officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him in his bed."
2CH	24	25	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16113	" So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings."
2CH	24	26	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16114	" {26} Those who conspired against him were Zabad, son of Shimeath an Ammonite woman, and Jehozabad, son of Shimrith a Moabite woman."

2CH	25	1	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16118	" {1} Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother's name was Jehoaddin; she was from Jerusalem."
2CH	25	2	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16119	" {2} He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, but not wholeheartedly. {3} After the kingdom was firmly in his control, he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king."
2CH	25	4	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16120	" {4} Yet he did not put their sons to death, but acted in accordance with what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the Lord commanded:"
2CH	25	4	God-FX1	#20		16121	" << Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sins.>>"
2CH	25	5	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16122	 {5} Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin.
2CH	25	5	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16123	" He then mustered those twenty years old or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men ready for military service, able to handle the spear and shield."
2CH	25	6	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16124	" {6} He also hired a hundred thousand fighting men from Israel for a hundred talents of silver. {7} But a man of God came to him and said,"
2CH	25	7	Man of God-FX1	#09		16125	" << O king, these troops from Israel must not march with you, for the Lord is not with Israel --not with any of the people of Ephraim."
2CH	25	8	Man of God-FX1	#09		16126	" {8} Even if you go and fight courageously in battle, God will overthrow you before the enemy, for God has the power to help or to overthrow.>>"
2CH	25	9	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16127	" {9} Amaziah asked the man of God,"
2CH	25	9	King Amaziah	#08		16128	 << But what about the hundred talents I paid for these Israelite troops?>>
2CH	25	9	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16129	" The man of God replied,"
2CH	25	9	Man of God-FX1	#09		16130	 << The Lord can give you much more than that.>>
2CH	25	10	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16131	 {10} So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. They were furious with Judah and left for home in a great rage.
2CH	25	11	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16132	" {11} Amaziah then marshaled his strength and led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he killed ten thousand men of Seir."
2CH	25	12	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16133	" {12} The army of Judah also captured ten thousand men alive, took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces."
2CH	25	13	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16134	 {13} Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to take part in the war raided Judean towns from Samaria to Beth Horon.
2CH	25	13	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16135	 They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder.
2CH	25	14	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16136	" {14} When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down to them and burned sacrifices to them."
2CH	25	15	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16137	" {15} The anger of the Lord burned against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said,"
2CH	25	15	Prophet	#03		16138	" << Why do you consult this people's gods, which could not save their own people from your hand?>>"
2CH	25	16	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16139	" {16} While he was still speaking, the king said to him,"

2CH	25	16	Prophet	#03		16142	" << I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.>>"
2CH	25	17	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16143	" {17} After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, he sent this challenge to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel:"
2CH	25	17	King Amaziah	#08		16144	" << Come, meet me face to face.>>"
2CH	25	18	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16145	 {18} But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah:
2CH	25	18	King Jehoash	#14		16146	" << A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.'"
2CH	25	18	King Jehoash	#14		16147	 Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot.
2CH	25	19	King Jehoash	#14		16148	" {19} You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom, and now you are arrogant and proud."
2CH	25	19	King Jehoash	#14		16149	 But stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?>>
2CH	25	20	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16150	" {20} Amaziah, however, would not listen, for God so worked that he might hand them over to Jehoash, because they sought the gods of Edom."
2CH	25	21	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16151	 {21} So Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah.
2CH	25	22	Narr_14: 2_Chronicles	#05		16152	" {22} Judah was routed by Israel, and every man fled to his home."

EZR	5	11	Tattenai	#03		16696	 {11} This is the answer they gave us:
EZR	5	11	Elder	#15		16697	" << We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, one that a great king of Israel built and finished."
EZR	5	12	Elder	#15		16698	" {12} But because our fathers angered the God of heaven, he handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean, king of Babylon, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon."

EZR	5	14	Elder	#15		16701	" << Then King Cyrus gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor,"
EZR	5	15	Elder	#15		16702	" {15} and he told him, 'Take these articles and go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem. And rebuild the house of God on its site.'"
EZR	5	16	Elder	#15		16703	 {16} So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem.
EZR	5	16	Elder	#15		16704	 From that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished.>>
EZR	5	17	Tattenai	#03		16705	" {17} Now if it pleases the king,"
EZR	5	17	Tattenai	#03		16706	 let a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem.

NEH	4	4	Nehemiah	#15		16990	" {4} Hear us, O our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity."
NEH	4	5	Nehemiah	#15		16991	" {5} Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders."
NEH	4	6	Nehemiah	#15		16992	" {6} So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart."
NEH	4	7	Narr_16: Nehemiah	#01		16993	" {7} But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the men of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem's walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed, they were very angry."
NEH	4	8	Narr_16: Nehemiah	#01		16994	 {8} They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it.
NEH	4	9	Nehemiah	#15		16995	" {9} But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat. {10} Meanwhile, the people in Judah said,"
NEH	4	10	Man	#06		16996	" << The strength of the laborers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall.>>"
NEH	4	11	Nehemiah	#15		16997	" {11} Also our enemies said,"
NEH	4	11	Enemy	#08		16998	" << Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work.>>"
NEH	4	12	Nehemiah	#15		16999	" {12} Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over,"

NEH	4	13	Nehemiah	#15		17001	" {13} Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears and bows."
NEH	4	14	Nehemiah	#15		17002	" {14} After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "

NEH	4	15	Nehemiah	#15		17004	" {15} When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his own work."
NEH	4	16	Nehemiah	#15		17005	" {16} From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows and armor. "

NEH	4	17	Nehemiah	#15		17007	" Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other, {18} and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. "
NEH	4	18	Nehemiah	#15		17008	" But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me. {19} Then I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "

NEH	5	2	Man	#05		17016	" << We and our sons and daughters are numerous; in order for us to eat and stay alive, we must get grain.>>"
NEH	5	3	Narr_16: Nehemiah	#01		17017	" {3} Others were saying,"

NEH	5	4	Narr_16: Nehemiah	#01		17019	" {4} Still others were saying,"
NEH	5	4	Man	#03		17020	 << We have had to borrow money to pay the king's tax on our fields and vineyards.
NEH	5	5	Man	#03		17021	" {5} Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our countrymen and though our sons are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery."
NEH	5	5	Man	#03		17022	" Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others.>>"
NEH	5	6	Nehemiah	#15		17023	" {6} When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry. {7} I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them, "
NEH	5	7	Nehemiah	#15		17024	 << You are exacting usury from your own countrymen!>> 
NEH	5	7	Nehemiah	#15		17025	 So I called together a large meeting to deal with them {8} and said: 
NEH	5	8	Nehemiah	#15		17026	" << As far as possible, we have bought back our Jewish brothers who were sold to the Gentiles.  Now you are selling your brothers, only for them to be sold back to us!>> "
NEH	5	8	Nehemiah	#15		17027	" They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say. {9} So I continued, "
NEH	5	9	Nehemiah	#15		17028	 << What you are doing is not right. Shouldn't you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies?
NEH	5	10	Nehemiah	#15		17029	 {10} I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let the exacting of usury stop!
NEH	5	11	Nehemiah	#15		17030	" {11} Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and houses, and also the usury you are charging them--the hundredth part of the money, grain, new wine and oil.>>"
NEH	5	12	Narr_16: Nehemiah	#01		17031	" {12} They said,"
NEH	5	12	Official	#10		17032	 << We will give it back. We will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say.>>
NEH	5	12	Nehemiah	#15		17033	 Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised.
NEH	5	13	Nehemiah	#15		17034	" {13} I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, "
NEH	5	13	Nehemiah	#15		17035	 << In this way may God shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep this promise. So may such a man be shaken out and emptied!>>
NEH	5	13	Narr_16: Nehemiah	#01		17036	" At this the whole assembly said, Amen and praised the Lord. And the people did as they had promised."
NEH	5	14	Nehemiah	#15		17037	" {14} Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year--twelve years--"
NEH	5	14	Nehemiah	#15		17038	 neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor.
NEH	5	15	Nehemiah	#15		17039	 {15} But the earlier governors--those preceding me--placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels of silver from them in addition to food and wine. 
NEH	5	15	Nehemiah	#15		17040	 Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God I did not act like that.
NEH	5	16	Nehemiah	#15		17041	" {16} Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we did not acquire any land."
NEH	5	17	Nehemiah	#15		17042	" {17} Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations."
NEH	5	18	Nehemiah	#15		17043	" {18} Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds."
NEH	5	18	Nehemiah	#15		17044	" In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people."

NEH	6	1	Nehemiah	#15		17047	" {1} When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it--"
NEH	6	1	Nehemiah	#15		17048	 though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates-- {2} Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message:
NEH	6	2	Sanballat	#13		17049	" << Come, let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono.>>"
NEH	6	2	Nehemiah	#15		17050	 But they were scheming to harm me; {3} so I sent messengers to them with this reply: 
NEH	6	3	Nehemiah	#15		17051	 I am carring on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?
NEH	6	4	Nehemiah	#15		17052	" {4} Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer."
NEH	6	5	Nehemiah	#15		17053	" {5} Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter {6} in which was written:"
NEH	6	6	Enemy	#14		17054	" << It is reported among the nations--and Geshem says it is true--that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. "
NEH	6	6	Enemy	#14		17055	" Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king"
NEH	6	7	Enemy	#14		17056	 {7} and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: 'There is a king in Judah!' 
NEH	6	7	Enemy	#14		17057	" Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us confer together.>>"
NEH	6	8	Nehemiah	#15		17058	 {8} I sent him this reply: << Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head.>>
NEH	6	9	Nehemiah	#15		17059	" {9} They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, << Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed.>> But I prayed, << Now strengthen my hands.>>"
NEH	6	10	Nehemiah	#15		17060	" {10} One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said,"
NEH	6	10	Shemaiah (bad)	#04		17061	" << Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you--by night they are coming to kill you.>>"
NEH	6	11	Nehemiah	#15		17062	" {11} But I said, << Should a man like me run away? Or should one like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!>>"
NEH	6	12	Nehemiah	#15		17063	" {12} I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
NEH	6	13	Nehemiah	#15		17064	" {13} He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me."
NEH	6	14	Nehemiah	#15		17065	" {14} Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me."
NEH	6	15	Nehemiah	#15		17066	" {15} So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days."
NEH	6	16	Nehemiah	#15		17067	" {16} When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God."
NEH	6	17	Nehemiah	#15		17068	" {17} Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them."
NEH	6	18	Nehemiah	#15		17069	" {18} For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah."

JOB	34	13	Elihu	#09		18427	 {13} Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?

JOB	35	8	Elihu	#09		18453	" {8} Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only the sons of men."
JOB	35	9	Elihu	#09		18454	 {9} << Men cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.

JOB	35	12	Elihu	#09		18457	 {12} He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.
JOB	35	13	Elihu	#09		18458	" {13} Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it."
JOB	35	14	Elihu	#09		18459	" {14} How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,"

ECC	4	1	Solomon	#10		21884	 I saw the tears of the oppressed-- and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors-- and they have no comforter.
ECC	4	2	Solomon	#10		21885	" {2} And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive."
ECC	4	3	Solomon	#10		21886	" {3} But better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun."
ECC	4	4	Solomon	#10		21887	" {4} And I saw that all labor and all achievement spring from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."

ECC	4	7	Solomon	#10		21890	 {7} Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:
ECC	4	8	Solomon	#10		21891	" {8} There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth."
ECC	4	8	Man	#08		21892	" << For whom am I toiling, and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment? >>"
ECC	4	8	Solomon	#10		21893	 This too is meaningless-- a miserable business! 
ECC	4	9	Solomon	#10		21894	" {9} Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work:"
ECC	4	10	Solomon	#10		21895	" {10} If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!"

ECC	5	2	Solomon	#10		21904	" {2} Do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few."

ECC	5	12	Solomon	#10		21914	" {12} The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of a rich man permits him no sleep."
ECC	5	13	Solomon	#10		21915	 {13} I have seen a grievous evil under the sun: 
ECC	5	13	Solomon	#10		21916	" wealth hoarded to the harm of its owner, {14} or wealth lost through some misfortune, so that when he has a son there is nothing left for him."
ECC	5	15	Solomon	#10		21917	" {15} Naked a man comes from his mother's womb, and as he comes, so he departs. He takes nothing from his labor that he can carry in his hand."

ECC	7	12	Solomon	#10		21951	" {12} Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: that wisdom preserves the life of its possessor."
ECC	7	13	Solomon	#10		21952	 {13} Consider what God has done: Who can straighten what he has made crooked?
ECC	7	14	Solomon	#10		21953	" {14} When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, a man cannot discover anything about his future."

ISA	28	4	Isaiah	#01		22805	" {4} That fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley, will be like a fig ripe before harvest-- as soon as someone sees it and takes it in his hand, he swallows it."

ISA	28	6	Isaiah	#01		22807	" {6} He will be a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate."
ISA	28	7	Isaiah	#01		22808	 {7} And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer: 
ISA	28	7	Isaiah	#01		22809	" Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions."
ISA	28	8	Isaiah	#01		22810	 {8} All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth.

ISA	28	12	Isaiah	#01		22815	" but they would not listen. {13} So then, the word of the Lord to them will become:"

ISA	28	13	Isaiah	#01		22817	" so that they will go and fall backward, be injured and snared and captured. {14} Therefore hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem. {15} You boast,"

ISA	28	19	Isaiah	#01		22824	" {19} As often as it comes it will carry you away; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through.>> The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror."
ISA	28	20	Isaiah	#01		22825	" {20} The bed is too short to stretch out on, the blanket too narrow to wrap around you."
ISA	28	21	Isaiah	#01		22826	" {21} The Lord will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon -- to do his work, his strange work, and perform his task, his alien task."
ISA	28	22	Isaiah	#01		22827	" {22} Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the Lord Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land."
ISA	28	23	Isaiah	#01		22828	" {23} Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say. {24} When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and harrowing the soil?"
ISA	28	25	Isaiah	#01		22829	" {25} When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cummin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, barley in its plot, and spelt in its field?"
ISA	28	26	Isaiah	#01		22830	 {26} His God instructs him and teaches him the right way.
ISA	28	27	Isaiah	#01		22831	" {27} Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a stick."
ISA	28	28	Isaiah	#01		22832	" {28} Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. Though he drives the wheels of his threshing cart over it, his horses do not grind it."

JER	22	6	God-FX1	#20		24432	" << Though you are like Gilead to me, like the summit of Lebanon, I will surely make you like a desert, like towns not inhabited."
JER	22	7	God-FX1	#20		24433	" {7} I will send destroyers against you, each man with his weapons, and they will cut up your fine cedar beams and throw them into the fire."
JER	22	8	God-FX1	#20		24434	" {8} << People from many nations will pass by this city and will ask one another, 'Why has the Lord done such a thing to this great city?'"
JER	22	9	God-FX1	#20		24435	 {9} And the answer will be: 'Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God and have worshiped and served other gods.'>>
JER	22	10	God-FX1	#20		24436	" {10} Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss; rather, weep bitterly for him who is exiled, because he will never return nor see his native land again."
JER	22	11	Jeremiah	#09		24437	" {11} For this is what the Lord says about Shallum son of Josiah, who succeeded his father as king of Judah but has gone from this place:"
JER	22	11	God-FX1	#20		24438	 << He will never return. {12} He will die in the place where they have led him captive; he will not see this land again.>>
JER	22	13	God-FX1	#20		24439	" {13} Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness, his upper rooms by injustice, making his countrymen work for nothing, not paying them for their labor."
JER	22	14	God-FX1	#20		24440	" {14} He says, 'I will build myself a great palace with spacious upper rooms.' So he makes large windows in it, panels it with cedar and decorates it in red."
JER	22	15	God-FX1	#20		24441	" {15} << Does it make you a king to have more and more cedar? Did not your father have food and drink? He did what was right and just, so all went well with him."
JER	22	16	God-FX1	#20		24442	" {16} He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so all went well. Is that not what it means to know me?"
JER	22	16	Jeremiah	#09		24443	 Declares the Lord
JER	22	17	God-FX1	#20		24444	" {17} <<But your eyes and your heart are set only on dishonest gain, on shedding innocent blood and on oppression and extortion.>>"
JER	22	18	Jeremiah	#09		24445	 {18} Therefore this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:
JER	22	18	God-FX1	#20		24446	" <<They will not mourn for him: 'Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!' They will not mourn for him: 'Alas, my master! Alas, his splendor!'"
JER	22	19	God-FX1	#20		24447	 {19} He will have the burial of a donkey-- dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.>>
JER	22	20	God-FX1	#20		24448	" {20} << Go up to Lebanon and cry out, let your voice be heard in Bashan, cry out from Abarim, for all your allies are crushed."
JER	22	21	God-FX1	#20		24449	" {21} I warned you when you felt secure, but you said, 'I will not listen!' This has been your way from your youth; you have not obeyed me."
JER	22	22	God-FX1	#20		24450	" {22} The wind will drive all your shepherds away, and your allies will go into exile. Then you will be ashamed and disgraced because of all your wickedness."
JER	22	23	God-FX1	#20		24451	" {23} You who live in 'Lebanon,' who are nestled in cedar buildings, how you will groan when pangs come upon you, pain like that of a woman in labor!"
JER	22	24	Jeremiah	#09		24452	" {24} The Lord declares,"
JER	22	24	God-FX1	#20		24453	" As surely as I live, even if you, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I would still pull you off."
JER	22	25	God-FX1	#20		24454	" {25} I will hand you over to those who seek your life, those you fear--to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to the Babylonians."
JER	22	26	God-FX1	#20		24455	" {26} I will hurl you and the mother who gave you birth into another country, where neither of you was born, and there you both will die."
JER	22	27	God-FX1	#20		24456	 {27} You will never come back to the land you long to return to.>>
JER	22	28	God-FX1	#20		24457	" {28} Is this man Jehoiachin a despised, broken pot, an object no one wants? Why will he and his children be hurled out, cast into a land they do not know?"
JER	22	29	God-FX1	#20		24458	" {29} O land, land, land, hear the word of the Lord! "
JER	22	30	Jeremiah	#09		24459	 {30} This is what the Lord says: 
JER	22	30	God-FX1	#20		24460	" << Record this man as if childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah.>>*~**~*||||| + 2 SECs |||||*~*"

JER	23	1	God-FX1	#20		24463	 << Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture!>>
JER	23	2	Jeremiah	#09		24464	" {2} Therefore this is what the Lord, the God of Israel says to the shepherds who tend my people:"
JER	23	2	God-FX1	#20		24465	" << Because you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not bestowed care on them, I will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done,>>"
JER	23	2	Jeremiah	#09		24466	 declares the Lord.
JER	23	3	God-FX1	#20		24467	" {3} << I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and increase in number."
JER	23	4	God-FX1	#20		24468	" {4} I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing."
JER	23	5	Jeremiah	#09		24469	" {5} The Lord declares,"
JER	23	5	God-FX1	#20		24470	" The days are coming when I will raise up to David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land."
JER	23	6	God-FX1	#20		24471	 {6} In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which he will be called: The Lord Our Righteousness.
JER	23	7	Jeremiah	#09		24472	" {7} The Lord declares,"
JER	23	7	God-FX1	#20		24473	" So then, the days are coming when people will no longer say, 'As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,'"
JER	23	8	God-FX1	#20		24474	" {8} but they will say, 'As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the descendants of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.' "
JER	23	8	God-FX1	#20		24475	 Then they will live in their own land.>>
JER	23	9	Jeremiah	#09		24476	" {9} Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me; all my bones tremble. I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, because of the Lord and his holy words."
JER	23	10	Jeremiah	#09		24477	 {10} The land is full of adulterers; because of the curse the land lies parched and the pastures in the desert are withered. The prophets follow an evil course and use their power unjustly.
JER	23	11	God-FX1	#20		24478	" {11} << Both prophet and priest are godless; even in my temple I find their wickedness,>>"

JER	23	13	God-FX1	#20		24482	 {13} Among the prophets of Samaria I saw this repulsive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.
JER	23	14	God-FX1	#20		24483	 {14} And among the prophets of Jerusalem. I have seen something horrible: They commit adultery and live a lie. 
JER	23	14	God-FX1	#20		24484	" They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from his wickedness. They are all like Sodom to me; the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.>>"
JER	23	15	Jeremiah	#09		24485	" {15} Therefore, this is what the Lord Almighty says concerning the prophets:"
JER	23	15	God-FX1	#20		24486	" << I will make them eat bitter food and drink poisoned water, because from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land.>>"
JER	23	16	Jeremiah	#09		24487	 {16} This is what the Lord Almighty says:
JER	23	16	God-FX1	#20		24488	" << Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you; they fill you with false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the Lord."
JER	23	17	God-FX1	#20		24489	" {17} They keep saying to those who despise me, 'The Lord says: You will have peace.' And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts they say, 'No harm will come to you.'"
JER	23	18	Jeremiah	#09		24490	 {18} But which of them has stood in the council of the Lord to see or to hear his word? Who has listened and heard his word?
JER	23	19	Jeremiah	#09		24491	" {19} See, the storm of the Lord will burst out in wrath, a whirlwind swirling down on the heads of the wicked."
JER	23	20	Jeremiah	#09		24492	 {20} The anger of the Lord will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come you will understand it clearly.
JER	23	21	God-FX1	#20		24493	" {21} I did not send these prophets, yet they have run with their message; I did not speak to them, yet they have prophesied."
JER	23	22	God-FX1	#20		24494	" {22} But if they had stood in my council, they would have proclaimed my words to my people and would have turned them from their evil ways and from their evil deeds."
JER	23	23	Jeremiah	#09		24495	" {23} The Lord declares,"
JER	23	23	God-FX1	#20		24496	" << Am I only a God nearby, and not a God far away?"
JER	23	24	Jeremiah	#09		24497	" {24} The Lord declares,"
JER	23	24	God-FX1	#20		24498	 <<Can anyone hide in secret places so that I cannot see him? Do not I fill Heaven and earth?>>
JER	23	24	Jeremiah	#09		24499	 declares the Lord.
JER	23	25	God-FX1	#20		24500	" {25} I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, 'I had a dream! I had a dream!'"
JER	23	26	God-FX1	#20		24501	" {26} How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds?"
JER	23	27	God-FX1	#20		24502	" {27} They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their fathers forgot my name through Baal worship."
JER	23	28	God-FX1	#20		24503	" {28} Let the prophet who has a dream tell his dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain? declares the Lord."
JER	23	29	Jeremiah	#09		24504	" declares the Lord. {29} He says,"
JER	23	29	God-FX1	#20		24505	" Is not my word like fire, and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?"
JER	23	30	Jeremiah	#09		24506	" {30} The Lord declares,"
JER	23	30	God-FX1	#20		24507	" << Therefore, I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me."
JER	23	31	Jeremiah	#09		24508	" {31} The Lord declares,"
JER	23	31	God-FX1	#20		24509	" Yes, I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, 'The Lord declares.' {32} Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams"

JER	23	33	Jeremiah	#09		24514	" ' What oracle? I will forsake you, declares the Lord.'"
JER	23	34	God-FX1	#20		24515	" {34} If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, 'This is the oracle of the Lord,' I will punish that man and his household."
JER	23	35	God-FX1	#20		24516	 {35} This is what each of you keeps on saying to his friend or relative: 'What is the Lord's answer?' or 'What has the Lord spoken?'
JER	23	36	God-FX1	#20		24517	" {36} But you must not mention 'the oracle of the Lord' again, because every man's own word becomes his oracle and so you distort the words of the living God, the Lord Almighty, our God."
JER	23	37	God-FX1	#20		24518	 {37} This is what you keep saying to a prophet: 'What is the Lord's answer to you?' or 'What has the Lord spoken?'

JER	24	1	Jeremiah	#09		24525	 the Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the Lord.
JER	24	2	Jeremiah	#09		24526	" {2} One basket had very good figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket had very poor figs, so bad they could not be eaten. {3} Then the Lord asked me,"

JER	24	3	Jeremiah	#09		24528	" << Figs,>> I answered. << The good ones are very good, but the poor ones are so bad they cannot be eaten.>> {4} Then the word of the Lord came to me:"

JER	25	2	Narr_24: Jeremiah	#13		24537	 {2} So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those living in Jerusalem:
JER	25	3	Jeremiah	#09		24538	" {3} For twenty-three years--from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day--the word of the Lord has come to me and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened."

JER	25	5	Prophet	#07		24540	" << Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil practices, and you can stay in the land the Lord gave to you and your fathers for ever and ever."
JER	25	6	Prophet	#07		24541	 {6} Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them; do not provoke me to anger with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you.>>

JER	25	8	Jeremiah	#09		24544	 {8} Therefore the Lord Almighty says this:
JER	25	8	God-FX1	#20		24545	" << Because you have not listened to my words,"
JER	25	9	Jeremiah	#09		24546	" {9} declares the Lord,"

EZE	1	4	Ezekiel	#15		25829	" {4} I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north--an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. "
EZE	1	4	Ezekiel	#15		25830	" The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, {5} and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. "
EZE	1	5	Ezekiel	#15		25831	" In appearance their form was that of a man, {6} but each of them had four faces and four wings."
EZE	1	7	Ezekiel	#15		25832	 {7} Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.
EZE	1	8	Ezekiel	#15		25833	 {8} Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. 
EZE	1	8	Ezekiel	#15		25834	" All four of them had faces and wings, {9} and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved."
EZE	1	10	Ezekiel	#15		25835	 {10} Their faces looked like this:
EZE	1	10	Ezekiel	#15		25836	" Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle."
EZE	1	11	Ezekiel	#15		25837	" {11} Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body."
EZE	1	12	Ezekiel	#15		25838	" {12} Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went."
EZE	1	13	Ezekiel	#15		25839	" {13} The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it."
EZE	1	14	Ezekiel	#15		25840	" {14} The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning. {15} As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces."
EZE	1	16	Ezekiel	#15		25841	" {16} This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel."
EZE	1	17	Ezekiel	#15		25842	" {17} As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about as the creatures went."
EZE	1	18	Ezekiel	#15		25843	" {18} Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around."
EZE	1	19	Ezekiel	#15		25844	" {19} When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose."
EZE	1	20	Ezekiel	#15		25845	" {20} Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
EZE	1	21	Ezekiel	#15		25846	" {21} When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; "
EZE	1	21	Ezekiel	#15		25847	" and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
EZE	1	22	Ezekiel	#15		25848	" {22} Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome."
EZE	1	23	Ezekiel	#15		25849	" {23} Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body."
EZE	1	24	Ezekiel	#15		25850	" {24} When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army. "
EZE	1	24	Ezekiel	#15		25851	" When they stood still, they lowered their wings."
EZE	1	25	Ezekiel	#15		25852	 {25} Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.
EZE	1	26	Ezekiel	#15		25853	" {26} Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man."
EZE	1	27	Ezekiel	#15		25854	" {27} I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him."
EZE	1	28	Ezekiel	#15		25855	" {28} Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him."

EZE	17	3	God-FX1	#20		26281	" Taking hold of the top of a cedar, {4} he broke off its topmost shoot and carried it away to a land of merchants, where he planted it in a city of traders."

EZE	23	13	Ezekiel	#15		26502	 {13} I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way.

EZE	23	17	Ezekiel	#15		26506	" {17} Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust."
EZE	23	18	Ezekiel	#15		26507	" {18} When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister."
EZE	23	19	Ezekiel	#15		26508	" {19} Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt."
EZE	23	20	Ezekiel	#15		26509	" {20} There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses."

EZE	33	1	Ezekiel	#15		26816	 {1} The word of the Lord came to me:
EZE	33	2	God-FX1	#20		26817	" {2} << Son of man, speak to your countrymen and say to them:"
EZE	33	2	God-FX1	#20		26818	" 'When I bring the sword against a land, and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman,"
EZE	33	3	Ezekiel	#15		26819	" {3} and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people,"
EZE	33	4	Ezekiel	#15		26820	" {4} then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not take warning and the sword comes and takes his life, his blood will be on his own head."
EZE	33	5	Ezekiel	#15		26821	" {5} Since he heard the sound of the trumpet but did not take warning, his blood will be on his own head. If he had taken warning, he would have saved himself."
EZE	33	6	Ezekiel	#15		26822	" {6} But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes the life of one of them, "
EZE	33	6	Ezekiel	#15		26823	" that man will be taken away because of his sin, but I will hold the watchman accountable for his blood.'"
EZE	33	7	Ezekiel	#15		26824	" {7} << Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me."
EZE	33	8	Ezekiel	#15		26825	" {8} When I say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you will surely die,' and you do not speak out to dissuade him from his ways, that wicked man will die for his sin, and I will hold you accountable for his blood."
EZE	33	9	Ezekiel	#15		26826	" {9} But if you do warn the wicked man to turn from his ways and he does not do so, he will die for his sin, but you will have saved yourself."
EZE	33	10	Ezekiel	#15		26827	" {10} << Son of man, say to the house of Israel, 'This is what you are saying: << Our offenses and sins weigh us down, and we are wasting away because of them. How then can we live?>> '"
EZE	33	11	Ezekiel	#15		26828	" {11} Say to them, 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. "
EZE	33	11	Ezekiel	#15		26829	" Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, O house of Israel?'"
EZE	33	12	God-FX1	#20		26830	" {12} << Therefore, son of man, say to your countrymen,"
EZE	33	12	God-FX1	#20		26831	" 'The righteousness of the righteous man will not save him when he disobeys, and the wickedness of the wicked man will not cause him to fall when he turns from it. "
EZE	33	12	God-FX1	#20		26832	" The righteous man, if he sins, will not be allowed to live because of his former righteousness.'"
EZE	33	13	Ezekiel	#15		26833	" {13} If I tell the righteous man that he will surely live, but then he trusts in his righteousness and does evil, none of the righteous things he has done will be remembered; he will die for the evil he has done."
EZE	33	14	Ezekiel	#15		26834	" {14} And if I say to the wicked man, 'You will surely die,' but he then turns away from his sin and does what is just and right--"
EZE	33	15	Ezekiel	#15		26835	" {15} if he gives back what he took in pledge for a loan, returns what he has stolen, follows the decrees that give life, and does no evil, he will surely live; he will not die."
EZE	33	16	Ezekiel	#15		26836	 {16} None of the sins he has committed will be remembered against him. He has done what is just and right; he will surely live.

EZE	33	19	Ezekiel	#15		26839	" {19} And if a wicked man turns away from his wickedness and does what is just and right, he will live by doing so."
EZE	33	20	Ezekiel	#15		26840	" {20} Yet, O house of Israel, you say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' But I will judge each of you according to his own ways.>>"
EZE	33	21	Ezekiel	#15		26841	" {21} In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month on on the fifth day, a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said,"

EZE	33	22	Ezekiel	#15		26843	" {22} Now the evening before the man arrived, the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth was opened and I was no longer silent."
EZE	33	23	Ezekiel	#15		26844	 {23} Then the word of the Lord came to me:

EZE	33	25	God-FX1	#20		26847	" {25} Therefore say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Since you eat meat with the blood still in it and look to your idols and shed blood, should you then possess the land?"
EZE	33	26	Ezekiel	#15		26848	" {26} You rely on your sword, you do detestable things, and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife. Should you then possess the land?'"

EZE	33	27	Ezekiel	#15		26850	" As surely as I live, those who are left in the ruins will fall by the sword, those out in the country I will give to the wild animals to be devoured, and those in strongholds and caves will die of a plague."
EZE	33	28	Ezekiel	#15		26851	" {28} I will make the land a desolate waste, and her proud strength will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel will become desolate so that no one will cross them."
EZE	33	29	Ezekiel	#15		26852	" {29} Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all the detestable things they have done.'"
EZE	33	30	God-FX1	#20		26853	" {30} << As for you, son of man, your countrymen are talking together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, saying to each other, 'Come and hear the message that has come from the Lord.'"
EZE	33	31	God-FX1	#20		26854	" {31} My people come to you, as they usually do, and sit before you to listen to your words, but they do not put them into practice. "
EZE	33	31	God-FX1	#20		26855	" With their mouths they express devotion, but their hearts are greedy for unjust gain."
EZE	33	32	God-FX1	#20		26856	" {32} Indeed, to them you are nothing more than one who sings love songs with a beautiful voice and plays an instrument well, for they hear your words but do not put them into practice."

EZE	34	2	God-FX1	#20		26861	 Woe to the shepherds of Israel who only take care of themselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock?
EZE	34	3	Ezekiel	#15		26862	" {3} You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock."
EZE	34	4	Ezekiel	#15		26863	 {4} You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally.
EZE	34	5	Ezekiel	#15		26864	" {5} So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals."
EZE	34	6	Ezekiel	#15		26865	" {6} My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them."

EZE	34	8	Ezekiel	#15		26868	" and because my shepherds did not search for my flock but cared for themselves rather than for my flock,"
EZE	34	9	Ezekiel	#15		26869	" {9} therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:"
EZE	34	10	God-FX1	#20		26870	 {10} This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock. 
EZE	34	10	God-FX1	#20		26871	" I will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds can no longer feed themselves. I will rescue my flock from their mouths, and it will no longer be food for them."

EZE	34	18	God-FX1	#20		26882	 {18} Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of your pasture with your feet?
EZE	34	18	God-FX1	#20		26883	 Is it not enough for you to drink clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet? {19} Must my flock feed on what you have trampled and drink what you have muddied with your feet?

DAN	2	27	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27451	" {27} Daniel replied,"
DAN	2	27	Daniel	#05		27452	" << No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, {28} but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. "
DAN	2	28	Daniel	#05		27453	 He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these:
DAN	2	29	Daniel	#05		27454	" {29} << As you were lying there, O king, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen."
DAN	2	30	Daniel	#05		27455	" {30} As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O king, may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind."
DAN	2	31	Daniel	#05		27456	" {31} << You looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue--an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance."
DAN	2	32	Daniel	#05		27457	" {32} The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, {33} its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay."
DAN	2	34	Daniel	#05		27458	" {34} While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them."
DAN	2	35	Daniel	#05		27459	" {35} Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. "
DAN	2	35	Daniel	#05		27460	 The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.
DAN	2	36	Daniel	#05		27461	" {36} << This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king."
DAN	2	37	Daniel	#05		27462	" {37} You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory;"
DAN	2	38	Daniel	#05		27463	" {38} in your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold."
DAN	2	39	Daniel	#05		27464	" {39} << After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth."
DAN	2	40	Daniel	#05		27465	" {40} Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron--for iron breaks and smashes everything--and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others."
DAN	2	41	Daniel	#05		27466	" {41} Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; "
DAN	2	41	Daniel	#05		27467	" yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay."
DAN	2	42	Daniel	#05		27468	" {42} As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle."
DAN	2	43	Daniel	#05		27469	" {43} And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay."
DAN	2	44	Daniel	#05		27470	" {44} << In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people."
DAN	2	44	Daniel	#05		27471	" It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever."
DAN	2	45	Daniel	#05		27472	" {45} This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands--a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. "
DAN	2	45	Daniel	#05		27473	 << The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy.>>
DAN	2	46	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27474	" {46} Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him. {47} The king said to Daniel,"
DAN	2	47	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27475	" << Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery.>>"
DAN	2	48	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27476	 {48} Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men.

DAN	4	2	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27523	 {2} It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me.
DAN	4	3	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27524	" {3} How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; his dominion endures from generation to generation."
DAN	4	4	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27525	" {4} I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my palace, contented and prosperous."
DAN	4	5	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27526	" {5} I had a dream that made me afraid. As I was lying in my bed, the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me."
DAN	4	6	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27527	 {6} So I commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me.
DAN	4	7	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27528	" {7} When the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners came, I told them the dream, but they could not interpret it for me."
DAN	4	8	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27529	" {8} Finally, Daniel came into my presence and I told him the dream. "
DAN	4	8	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27530	" (He is called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.)"
DAN	4	9	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27531	" {9} I said, << Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you. Here is my dream; interpret it for me."
DAN	4	10	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27532	" {10} These are the visions I saw while lying in my bed: I looked, and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its height was enormous."
DAN	4	11	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27533	 {11} The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky; it was visible to the ends of the earth.
DAN	4	12	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27534	" {12} Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all."
DAN	4	12	Nebuchadnezzar	#17		27535	" Under it the beasts of the field found shelter, and the birds of the air lived in its branches; from it every creature was fed."

DAN	4	19	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27545	" {19} Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar ) was greatly perplexed for a time, and his thoughts terrified him. So the king said,"

DAN	4	22	Daniel	#05		27551	" {22} you, O king, are that tree! You have become great and strong; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth."

DAN	5	1	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27578	 {1} King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them.
DAN	5	2	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27579	" {2} While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, "
DAN	5	2	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27580	" so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them."
DAN	5	3	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27581	" {3} So they brought in the gold goblets that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them."
DAN	5	4	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27582	" {4} As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone."
DAN	5	5	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27583	" {5} Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote."
DAN	5	6	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27584	 {6} His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way.
DAN	5	7	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27585	" {7} The king called out for the enchanters, astrologers and diviners to be brought and said to these wise men of Babylon,"
DAN	5	7	Belshazzar	#14		27586	" << Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means, will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.>>"
DAN	5	8	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27587	" {8} Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant."
DAN	5	9	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27588	 {9} So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled.
DAN	5	10	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27589	" {10} The queen, hearing the voices of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet hall."
DAN	5	10	Queen	#24		27590	" << O king, live forever! Don't be alarmed! Don't look so pale!"
DAN	5	11	Queen	#24		27591	 {11} There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. 
DAN	5	11	Queen	#24		27592	 In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. 
DAN	5	11	Queen	#24		27593	" King Nebuchadnezzar your father--your father the king, I say--appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners."

DAN	5	12	Queen	#24		27595	" and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.>>"
DAN	5	13	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27596	" {13} So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him,"

DAN	5	14	Belshazzar	#14		27598	" {14} I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom."
DAN	5	15	Belshazzar	#14		27599	" {15} The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not explain it."
DAN	5	16	Belshazzar	#14		27600	 {16} Now I have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems.
DAN	5	16	Belshazzar	#14		27601	" If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.>>"
DAN	5	17	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27602	" {17} Then Daniel answered the king,"
DAN	5	17	Daniel	#05		27603	" << You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means."
DAN	5	18	Daniel	#05		27604	" {18} << O king, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor."
DAN	5	19	Daniel	#05		27605	" {19} Because of the high position he gave him, all the peoples and nations and men of every language dreaded and feared him. "
DAN	5	19	Daniel	#05		27606	" Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to death; those he wanted to spare, he spared; those he wanted to promote, he promoted; and those he wanted to humble, he humbled."
DAN	5	20	Daniel	#05		27607	" {20} But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory."
DAN	5	21	Daniel	#05		27608	 {21} He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like cattle; 
DAN	5	21	Daniel	#05		27609	" and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone he wishes."
DAN	5	22	Daniel	#05		27610	" {22} << But you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this. {23} Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. "
DAN	5	23	Daniel	#05		27611	" You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them."
DAN	5	23	Daniel	#05		27612	" You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. "
DAN	5	23	Daniel	#05		27613	 But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways. {24} Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription.
DAN	5	25	Daniel	#05		27614	" {25} << This is the inscription that was written: mene, mene, tekel, parsin"
DAN	5	26	Daniel	#05		27615	 {26} << This is what these words mean: Mene: God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.
DAN	5	27	Daniel	#05		27616	 {27} Tekel: You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting. {28} Peres: Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.>>
DAN	5	29	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27617	" {29} Then at Belshazzar's command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom."
DAN	5	30	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27618	" {30} That very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians, was slain, {31} and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two.*~**~*||||| + 2 SECs |||||*~*"

DAN	6	2	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27621	 The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss.
DAN	6	3	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27622	 {3} Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.
DAN	6	4	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27623	" {4} At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. "
DAN	6	4	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27624	" They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent. {5} Finally these men said,"
DAN	6	5	Satrap	#15		27625	 << We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.>>
DAN	6	6	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27626	 {6} So the administrators and the satraps went as a group to the king and said:
DAN	6	6	Satrap	#15		27627	" << O King Darius, live forever! "
DAN	6	7	Satrap	#15		27628	" {7} The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree, "

DAN	6	9	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27632	 {9} So King Darius put the decree in writing.
DAN	6	10	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27633	" {10} Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. "
DAN	6	10	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27634	" Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before."
DAN	6	11	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27635	 {11} Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help. {12} So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree:
DAN	6	12	Satrap	#15		27636	" << Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or man except to you, O king, would be thrown into the lions' den?>>"

DAN	6	13	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27639	" {13} Then they said to the king,"
DAN	6	13	Satrap	#15		27640	" << Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day.>>"

DAN	6	15	Satrap	#15		27643	" << Remember, O king, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed.>>"
DAN	6	16	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27644	" {16} So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions' den. The king said to Daniel,"

DAN	6	17	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27646	" {17} A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel's situation might not be changed."
DAN	6	18	Narr_27: Daniel	#13		27647	 {18} Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep.

DAN	7	5	Daniel	#05		27669	" {5} << And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. "
DAN	7	5	Daniel	#05		27670	" It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of flesh!'"
DAN	7	6	Daniel	#05		27671	" {6} << After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. "
DAN	7	6	Daniel	#05		27672	" And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule."
DAN	7	7	Daniel	#05		27673	" {7} << After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast--terrifying and frightening and very powerful."
DAN	7	7	Daniel	#05		27674	" It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns."
DAN	7	8	Daniel	#05		27675	" {8} << While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; "
DAN	7	8	Daniel	#05		27676	 and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully.
DAN	7	9	Daniel	#05		27677	" {9} << As I looked, << thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; "
DAN	7	9	Daniel	#05		27678	" the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze."
DAN	7	10	Daniel	#05		27679	" {10} A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. "
DAN	7	10	Daniel	#05		27680	" Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened."
DAN	7	11	Daniel	#05		27681	 {11} << Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.
DAN	7	12	Daniel	#05		27682	" {12} (The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.)"
DAN	7	13	Daniel	#05		27683	" {13} << In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence."
DAN	7	14	Daniel	#05		27684	" {14} He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. "
DAN	7	14	Daniel	#05		27685	" His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed."
DAN	7	15	Daniel	#05		27686	" {15} << I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me."
DAN	7	16	Daniel	#05		27687	 {16} I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. << So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things:
DAN	7	17	Angel #1-FX1	#10		27688	 {17} 'The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth.
DAN	7	18	Angel #1-FX1	#10		27689	" {18} But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever--yes, for ever and ever.'"
DAN	7	19	Daniel	#05		27690	" {19} <<Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws--"
DAN	7	19	Daniel	#05		27691	 the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left.
DAN	7	20	Daniel	#05		27692	" {20} I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell--"
DAN	7	20	Daniel	#05		27693	 the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully.
DAN	7	21	Daniel	#05		27694	" {21} As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them,"
DAN	7	22	Daniel	#05		27695	" {22} until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom."
DAN	7	23	Daniel	#05		27696	 {23} << He gave me this explanation:
DAN	7	23	Angel #1-FX1	#10		27697	" 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it."
DAN	7	24	Angel #1-FX1	#10		27698	" {24} The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings."
DAN	7	25	Angel #2-FX1	#07		27699	" {25} He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time."
DAN	7	26	Angel #2-FX1	#07		27700	" {26} << 'But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever."
DAN	7	27	Angel #2-FX1	#07		27701	" {27} Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. "
DAN	7	27	Angel #2-FX1	#07		27702	" His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.'"

DAN	8	1	Daniel	#05		27705	" {1} In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me."
DAN	8	2	Daniel	#05		27706	 {2} In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.
DAN	8	3	Daniel	#05		27707	" {3} I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later."
DAN	8	4	Daniel	#05		27708	 {4} I watched the ram as he charged toward the west and the north and the south. 
DAN	8	4	Daniel	#05		27709	" No animal could stand against him, and none could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great."
DAN	8	5	Daniel	#05		27710	" {5} As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground."
DAN	8	6	Daniel	#05		27711	 {6} He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at him in great rage.
DAN	8	7	Daniel	#05		27712	" {7} I saw him attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering his two horns. "
DAN	8	7	Daniel	#05		27713	" The ram was powerless to stand against him; the goat knocked him to the ground and trampled on him, and none could rescue the ram from his power."
DAN	8	8	Daniel	#05		27714	" {8} The goat became very great, but at the height of his power his large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven."
DAN	8	9	Daniel	#05		27715	" {9} Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land."
DAN	8	10	Daniel	#05		27716	" {10} It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them."
DAN	8	11	Daniel	#05		27717	" {11} It set itself up to be as great as the Prince of the host; it took away the daily sacrifice from him, and the place of his sanctuary was brought low."
DAN	8	12	Daniel	#05		27718	" {12} Because of rebellion, the host of the saints and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground."
DAN	8	13	Daniel	#05		27719	" {13} Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him,"
DAN	8	13	Angel #1-FX1	#10		27720	 << How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled--
DAN	8	13	Angel #1-FX1	#10		27721	" the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host that will be trampled underfoot?>>"
DAN	8	14	Daniel	#05		27722	" {14} He said to me,"
DAN	8	14	Angel #2-FX1	#07		27723	" << It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated.>>"
DAN	8	15	Daniel	#05		27724	" {15} While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man. {16} And I heard a man's voice from the Ulai calling,"
DAN	8	16	Man's Voice	#09		27725	" << Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.>>"
DAN	8	17	Daniel	#05		27726	" {17} As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. << Son of man, understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.>>"
DAN	8	18	Daniel	#05		27727	" {18} While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet. {19} He said:"
DAN	8	19	Gabriel-FX1	#11		27728	" << I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end."
DAN	8	20	Gabriel-FX1	#11		27729	 {20} The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia.
DAN	8	21	Gabriel-FX1	#11		27730	" {21} The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between his eyes is the first king."
DAN	8	22	Gabriel-FX1	#11		27731	 {22} The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.
DAN	8	23	Gabriel-FX1	#11		27732	" {23} << In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a stern-faced king, a master of intrigue, will arise."
DAN	8	24	Gabriel-FX1	#11		27733	" {24} He will become very strong, but not by his own power. "
DAN	8	24	Gabriel-FX1	#11		27734	 He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the mighty men and the holy people.
DAN	8	25	Gabriel-FX1	#11		27735	" {25} He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. "
DAN	8	25	Gabriel-FX1	#11		27736	" When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power."
DAN	8	26	Gabriel-FX1	#11		27737	" {26} << The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.>>"
DAN	8	27	Daniel	#05		27738	" {27} I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for several days. "
DAN	8	27	Daniel	#05		27739	 Then I got up and went about the king's business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding.*~**~*||||| + 2 SECs |||||*~*

DAN	9	2	Daniel	#05		27742	" {2} in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the Lord given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years."
DAN	9	3	Daniel	#05		27743	" {3} So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes. {4} I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed: "
DAN	9	4	Daniel	#05		27744	" << O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with all who love him and obey his commands, {5} we have sinned and done wrong. "
DAN	9	5	Daniel	#05		27745	 We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws.
DAN	9	6	Daniel	#05		27746	" {6} We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our fathers, and to all the people of the land."

DAN	9	8	Daniel	#05		27749	" {8} O Lord, we and our kings, our princes and our fathers are covered with shame because we have sinned against you."
DAN	9	9	Daniel	#05		27750	" {9} The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him;"
DAN	9	10	Daniel	#05		27751	 {10} we have not obeyed the Lord our God or kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets.

DAN	9	12	Daniel	#05		27755	 Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem.
DAN	9	13	Daniel	#05		27756	" {13} Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us, yet we have not sought the favor of the Lord our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth."
DAN	9	14	Daniel	#05		27757	" {14} The Lord did not hesitate to bring the disaster upon us, for the Lord our God is righteous in everything he does; yet we have not obeyed him."
DAN	9	15	Daniel	#05		27758	" {15} << Now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong."

DAN	9	16	Daniel	#05		27760	 Our sins and the iniquities of our fathers have made Jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to all those around us.

DAN	9	19	Daniel	#05		27764	" {19} O Lord, listen! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, hear and act! For your sake, O my God, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your Name.>>"

MAL	1	3	Malachi	#05		29227	 I have turned his mountains into a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.>> 
MAL	1	4	Malachi	#05		29228	" {4} Edom may say,"
MAL	1	4	Edom	#06		29229	" << Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins.>>"
MAL	1	4	Malachi	#05		29230	" But this is what the Lord Almighty says: << They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land, a people always under the wrath of the Lord."
MAL	1	5	Malachi	#05		29231	" {5} You will see it with your own eyes and say,"
MAL	1	5	Man	#17		29232	 Great is the Lord--even beyond the borders of Israel!'
MAL	1	6	Malachi	#05		29233	" {6} << A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, where is the honor due me? If I am a master, where is the respect due me?>> says the Lord Almighty. "

MAL	1	8	Malachi	#05		29239	 Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you?>> says the Lord Almighty.
MAL	1	9	Malachi	#05		29240	" {9} << Now implore God to be gracious to us. With such offerings from your hands, will he accept you?>>--says the Lord Almighty."

MAL	1	10	Malachi	#05		29242	" I am not pleased with you,>> says the Lord Almighty, << and I will accept no offering from your hands."

MAL	1	11	Malachi	#05		29244	" In every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to my name, because my name will be great among the nations,>> says the Lord Almighty."
MAL	1	12	Malachi	#05		29245	" {12} << But you profane it by saying of the Lord's table, It is defiled! and of its food, It is contemptible!"
MAL	1	13	Malachi	#05		29246	" {13} And you say: What a burden!, and you sniff at it contemptuously,>> says the Lord Almighty."

MAL	2	2	Malachi	#05		29253	" Yes, I have already cursed them, because you have not set your heart to honor me."
MAL	2	3	Malachi	#05		29254	" {3} << Because of you I will rebuke your descendants; I will spread on your faces the offal from your festival sacrifices, and you will be carried off with it."
MAL	2	4	Malachi	#05		29255	" {4} And you will know that I have sent you this admonition so that my covenant with Levi may continue, says the Lord Almighty."
MAL	2	5	God-FX1	#20		29256	" {5} My covenant was with him, a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him; this called for reverence and he revered me and stood in awe of my name."
MAL	2	6	God-FX1	#20		29257	" {6} True instruction was in his mouth and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many from sin."

MAL	2	8	Malachi	#05		29259	" {8} But you have turned from the way and by your teaching have caused many to stumble; you have violated the covenant with Levi,>> says the Lord Almighty."
MAL	2	9	God-FX1	#20		29260	" {9} << So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people, because you have not followed my ways but have shown partiality in matters of the law.>>"
MAL	2	10	Malachi	#05		29261	 {10} Have we not all one Father? Did not one God create us? Why do we profane the covenant of our fathers by breaking faith with one another?
MAL	2	11	Malachi	#05		29262	" {11} Judah has broken faith. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem: Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the Lord loves, by marrying the daughter of a foreign god."
MAL	2	12	Malachi	#05		29263	" {12} As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, may the Lord cut him off from the tents of Jacob--even though he brings offerings to the Lord Almighty."
MAL	2	13	Malachi	#05		29264	 {13} Another thing you do: You flood the Lord's altar with tears. 
MAL	2	13	Malachi	#05		29265	 You weep and wail because he no longer pays attention to your offerings or accepts them with pleasure from your hands.
MAL	2	14	Malachi	#05		29266	" {14} You ask, << Why?>> It is because the Lord is acting as the witness between you and the wife of your youth,"
MAL	2	14	Malachi	#05		29267	" because you have broken faith with her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant."
MAL	2	15	Malachi	#05		29268	 {15} Has not the Lord made them one? In flesh and spirit they are his. And why one? 
MAL	2	15	Malachi	#05		29269	" Because he was seeking godly offspring. So guard yourself in your spirit, and do not break faith with the wife of your youth. {16} The Lord Almighty says,"
MAL	2	16	God-FX1	#20		29270	" I hate divorce, and I hate the man who does wrong to his wife. So be careful in your spirit and be one who can be trusted."
MAL	2	17	Malachi	#05		29271	 {17} You have wearied the Lord with your words.

MAL	3	3	Malachi	#05		29282	" Then the Lord will have men who will bring offerings in righteousness, {4} and the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to the Lord, as in days gone by, as in former years."
