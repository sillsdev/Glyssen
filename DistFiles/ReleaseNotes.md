# Getting Started
Glyssen assists with the process of preparing an audio recording script for
dramatizing Scripture. It is intended for producing publishable-quality recordings.
To start a new project in  Glyssen, you will need either a Digital Bible Library "text
release bundle" with at least one book of Scripture that has been approved for
publishing or a "live" Paratext project on your computer. Glyssen does not read plain
Standard Format files. Once you have created a project and made a few basic decisions
about project settings and what books to record, there are four main phases to the
recording project:

1. Identify speaking parts and align vernacular script blocks with the reference text. Ideally, this task should be done by someone who knows both the vernacular language and the reference text language(s). If the vernacular text uses consistent quotation mark punctuation, Glyssen can usually do most of this work for you. In a relatively small number of places, it will require you to confirm its guesses or make manual decisions. This process can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days.
2. Make cast selections. This involves deciding how many voice actors you will use, identifying those people, and having Glyssen help divide up the work among them.
3. Field recording. Glyssen is not a recording tool. If you are not working with a ministry partner to do this phase (see below), one option is to use HearThis version 2.0 or greater. You can also use recording software such as Audacity or Adobe Audition to record all the clips for each voice actor. Be sure to set up an environment that minimizes ambient noise and use high-quality recording equipment to get the best possible results.
4. Post-production. This is key to getting a great-sounding final product. Glyssen doesn't really help with this part of the process, other than to include annotations in the scripts it produces that can help the post-production team.

It is strongly recommended that field teams work with an experienced ministry partner
to ensure a successful recording project. In most cases, Faith Comes By Hearing is able
to assist teams with all phases of a project. (They can even do step 1 for you, but you
might find it beneficial to do it yourself or at least get involved in that.) If you are
working with IMS, FCBH, or another partner, you will want to discuss the overall project
plan with them before starting to use Glyssen. That will help you avoid unnecessary work.

If you have problems, suggestions or positive comments that might help the developers
secure needed funds to continue the development of Glyssen, please email:

# What to Back Up
Glyssen stores all its project files in the Program Data folder, under the
SIL-FCBH\Glyssen directory. On a default installation of Windows 7, that would be
here: <a href="file:///C:/ProgramData/FCBH-SIL/Glyssen">
C:\ProgramData\FCBH-SIL\Glyssen</a>. To support multiple
recording projects, versions, and languages, there will be three levels of subfolders
under that folder. Back up the whole thing. If you are using Glyssen to generate empty
clip files for the recording phase, the software lets you choose where to create those.
Back those up also. If your project is based on a text release bundle that is in the
Digital Bible Library and you have access to that, you don't need to back it up, but
for the sake of convenience, you may want to. You might also want to back up any glyssenshare
files (usually found in <a href="file:///C:/ProgramData/FCBH-SIL/Glyssen/share">
C:\ProgramData\FCBH-SIL\Glyssen\share</a>) or exported Excel or glyssenscript files.
(If you have saved these in My Documents, they will likely already be part of your normal
back-up plan.)
