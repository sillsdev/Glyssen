  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="22" characterId="narrator-EST">

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="4" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <text>The thing pleased the king, and he did so.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="5" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="5" />
    <text>There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="6" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="6" />
    <text>who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="7" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="7" />
    <text>He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter; for she had neither father nor mother. The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="8" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="8" />
    <text>So it happened, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="9" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="9" />
    <text>The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king’s house. He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women’s house.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="10" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="10" />
    <text>Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="11" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="11" />
    <text>Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women’s house, to find out how Esther did, and what would become of her.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="12" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="12" />
    <text>Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women).</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="13" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="13" />
    <text>The young woman then came to the king like this: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women’s house to the king’s house.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="14" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="14" />
    <text>In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women’s house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="15" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="15" />
    <text>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="16" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="16" />
    <text>So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="17" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="17" />
    <text>The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="18" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="18" />
    <text>Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king’s bounty.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="19" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="19" />
    <text>When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate.</text>

    <verse num="20" />
    <text>Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="21" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="21" />
    <text>In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="22" characterId="narrator-EST">
    <verse num="22" />
    <text>This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="23" characterId="narrator-EST">

    <text>When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king’s presence.</text>

    <text>After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="2" characterId="narrator-EST">

    <text>All the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn’t bow down or pay him homage.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="3" characterId="narrator-EST">

    <text>Then the king’s servants, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai,</text>

    <text>Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn’t listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="5" characterId="narrator-EST">

    <text>When Haman saw that Mordecai didn’t bow down, nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath.</text>

    <text>But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai’s people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even Mordecai’s people.</text>
