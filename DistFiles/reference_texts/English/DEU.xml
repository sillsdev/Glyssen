    <text>Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country. </text>

    <text>The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.</text>

    <text>Command the people, saying, ‹You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take good heed to yourselves therefore;</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="5" characterId="Moses">
    <verse num="5" />
    <text>don’t contend with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="6" characterId="Moses">

    <text>You shall purchase food of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.›</text>

    <text>So we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. </text>
    <verse num="9" />
    <text>God said to me,</text>

    <text>these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.</text>

    <text>Now rise up, and cross over the brook Zered. We went over the brook Zered.</text>

    <text>The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as God swore to them.</text>
