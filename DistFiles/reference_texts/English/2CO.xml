    <text>But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort. It produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="18" characterId="narrator-2CO">

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="20" characterId="narrator-2CO">

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="4" characterId="narrator-2CO">

    <text>The service of death, written engraved on stones, came with glory. With such glory that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which was passing away.</text>
