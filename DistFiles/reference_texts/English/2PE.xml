  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="9" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="9" />

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="16" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="16" />
    <text>For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. We were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</text>

    <verse num="19" />
    <text>We have the more sure word of prophecy; and you do well that you heed it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the morning star arises in your hearts.</text>

    <text>Know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture has been made up by prophet.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="21" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="21" />

    <text>But false prophets also arose among the people, as false teachers will also be among you. They will secretly bring in damnable heresies, denying even the Master who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.</text>

    <text>In covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words: whose sentence now from of old doesn’t linger, and their destruction will not slumber.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="4" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="4" />
    <text>For God didn’t spare angels when they sinned, but cast them down to Tartarus, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved for judgment.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="5" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="5" />
    <text>And God didn’t spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="6" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="6" />
    <text>God turned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes and condemned them to destruction. He made them an example to those who would live ungodly.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="9" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="9" />
    <text>But the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="10" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="10" />
    <text>This is especially true of those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise authority. Daring, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="11" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="11" />
    <text>Whereas angels, though greater in might and power, don’t bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="12" characterId="narrator-2PE">

    <text>But these, as unreasoning creatures, born natural animals to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant, will in their destroying surely be destroyed.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="13" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="13" />
    <text>They will be paid back with harm for the harm that they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes reveling in their deceit while they feast with you.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="14" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="14" />
    <text>With eyes full of adultery, they can’t cease from sin; enticing unsettled souls; having a heart trained in greed; children of cursing.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="15" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="15" />
    <text>They forsake the right way. They went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wrongdoing.</text>

    <verse num="16" />

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="17" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="17" />
    <text>These are wells without water, clouds driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="18" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="18" />
    <text>For, uttering great swelling words of emptiness, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by licentiousness, those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="19" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="19" />
    <text>They promise them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for a man is brought into bondage by whoever overcomes him.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="20" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="20" />
    <text>For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in it and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="21" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="21" />
    <text>For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.</text>

    <text>This is now, beloved, the second letter that I have written to you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding you of some things.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="2" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="2" />
    <text>You should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="5" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="5" />
    <text>For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth formed out of water and amid water, by the word of God.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="6" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="6" />
    <text>By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="7" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="7" />
    <text>But the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="8" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="8" />
    <text>But don’t forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="9" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="9" />
    <text>The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness. He is patient with us, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="10" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="10" />
    <text>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="11" characterId="narrator-2PE">

  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="12" characterId="narrator-2PE">
    <verse num="12" />
    <text>You should be looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, which will cause the burning heavens to be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="13" characterId="narrator-2PE">

    <text>He wrote about these things in all of his letters, speaking in them of these things. In those, there are some things that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unsettled twist, as they also do to the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</text>
