    <verse num="2" />
    <text>The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</text>

    <text>youths in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and endowed with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.</text>

    <text>The king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s delicacies, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at its end they should stand before the king.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="6" characterId="narrator-DAN">

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="8" characterId="narrator-DAN">

    <text>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s delicacies, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="9" characterId="narrator-DAN">

    <text>Now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs. </text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="10" characterId="chief official">
    <text>I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths who are of your own age? so would you endanger my head with the king.</text>

    <verse num="11" />
    <text>Then Daniel said to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</text>

    <text>Then let our faces be looked on before you, and the face of the youths who eat of the king’s delicacies; and as you see, deal with your servants.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="14" characterId="narrator-DAN">

    <text>So he listened to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</text>

    <text>In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="2" characterId="narrator-DAN">

    <text>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king. </text>

    <text>The king said to them,</text>

    <text>Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language,</text>

    <text>The king answered the Chaldeans,.</text>

    <text>The thing is gone from me: if you don't make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</text>

    <text>I know of a certainty that you would gain time, because you see the thing is gone from me.</text>

  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="10" characterId="narrator-DAN">

    <text>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said,</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="10" characterId="astrologers">
    <text>There is not a man on the earth who can show the king's matter, because no king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="12" characterId="narrator-DAN">

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="15" characterId="narrator-DAN">
    <verse num="15" />
    <text>he answered Arioch the king’s captain,</text>

    <text>Why is the decree so urgent from the king?</text>

    <text>Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. </text>

    <text>Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="17" characterId="narrator-DAN">
    <verse num="17" />
    <text>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="18" characterId="narrator-DAN">
    <verse num="18" />
    <text>that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="19" characterId="narrator-DAN">
    <verse num="19" />
    <text>Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. </text>
    <verse num="20" />
    <text>Daniel answered,</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="20" characterId="Daniel">
    <text>Blessed be the name of God forever and ever; for wisdom and might are his.</text>

    <verse num="23" />
    <text>I thank you, and praise you, you God of my fathers, who have given me wisdom and might, and have now made known to me what we desired of you; for you have made known to us the king’s matter.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="24" characterId="narrator-DAN">

    <text>Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus to him:</text>

    <text>Don't destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.</text>

    <text>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him,</text>

    <text>I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="26" characterId="narrator-DAN">
    <verse num="26" />
    <text>The king answered Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar,</text>

    <text>The secret which the king has demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show to the king;</text>

    <verse num="28" />
    <text>but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these:</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="29" characterId="Daniel">

    <text>as for you, O king, your thoughts came into your mind on your bed, what should happen hereafter; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what shall happen.</text>

    <text>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="32" characterId="Daniel">
    <verse num="32" />
    <text>As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, </text>
