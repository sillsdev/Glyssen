  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="9" characterId="narrator-DAN">

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="10" characterId="narrator-DAN">

    <text>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said,</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="10" characterId="astrologers">
    <text>There is not a man on the earth who can show the king's matter, because no king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.</text>

    <text>Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="17" characterId="narrator-DAN">
    <verse num="17" />

  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="18" characterId="narrator-DAN">
    <verse num="18" />

  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="19" characterId="narrator-DAN">
    <verse num="19" />
    <text>Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. </text>

    <text>Daniel answered,</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="24" characterId="narrator-DAN">

    <text>Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus to him:</text>

    <text>Don't destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.</text>

    <text>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him,</text>

    <text>The king answered Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar,</text>

    <text>The secret which the king has demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show to the king;</text>

    <text>but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these:</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="32" characterId="Daniel">
    <verse num="32" />
    <text>As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, </text>
