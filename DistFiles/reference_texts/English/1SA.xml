    <text>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="2" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="2" />
    <text>He had two wives. The name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="3" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="3" />
    <text>This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Armies in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="4" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="4" />
    <text>When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters;</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="5" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="5" />
    <text>but he gave a double portion to Hannah, for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="6" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="6" />
    <text>Her rival provoked her severely, to irritate her, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="7" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="7" />
    <text>So year by year, when she went up to Yahweh’s house, her rival provoked her. Therefore she wept, and didn’t eat.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="8" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="8" />
    <text>Elkanah her husband said to her,</text>

    <text>«Hannah, why do you weep? Why don’t you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?»</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="9" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="9" />
    <text>So Hannah rose up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh’s temple.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="10" characterId="narrator-1SA">

    <text>She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, weeping bitterly.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="11" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="11" />
    <text>She vowed a vow, and said,</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="11" characterId="Hannah">
    <text>«Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed look at the affliction of your servant and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a boy, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head.»</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="12" characterId="narrator-1SA">

    <text>As she continued praying before Yahweh, Eli saw her mouth.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="13" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="13" />
    <text>Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="14" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="14" />
    <text>Eli said to her,</text>

  </block>

    <text>Hannah answered,</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="15" characterId="Hannah">
    <text>«No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have not been drinking wine or strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.</text>

    <text>Don’t consider your servant a wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation.»</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="17" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="17" />
    <text>Then Eli answered,</text>

    <text>«Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.»</text>

    <text>«Let your servant find favor in your sight.»</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="18" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <text>So the woman went her way and ate; and her facial expression wasn’t sad any more.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="19" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="19" />
    <text>They rose up in the morning early and worshiped Yahweh, then returned and came to their house to Ramah. Then Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="20" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="20" />
    <text>When the time had come, Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, saying,</text>

    <text>«Because I have asked him of Yahweh.»</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="21" characterId="narrator-1SA">

    <text>The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice and his vow.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="22" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="22" />
    <text>But Hannah didn’t go up, for she said to her husband,</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="22" characterId="Hannah">
    <text>«Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and stay there forever.»</text>

    <text>When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a container of wine, and brought him to Yahweh’s house in Shiloh. The child was young.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="25" characterId="narrator-1SA">
