    <text>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="2" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="2" />
    <text>and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="3" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="3" />
    <text>This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to God of Armies in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to God, were there.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="4" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="4" />
    <text>When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="5" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="5" />
    <text>but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but God had shut up her womb.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="6" characterId="narrator-1SA">

    <text>Her rival provoked her severely, to make her fret, because God had shut up her womb.</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="7" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="7" />
    <text>as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of God, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="8" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="8" />
    <text>Elkanah her husband said to her,</text>

    <text>“Hannah, why do you weep? Why don't you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”</text>

    <text>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the temple of God.</text>

    <text>“God of Armies, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a boy, then I will give him to God all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head.”</text>

    <text>Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. </text>

    <text>Eli said to her,</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="20" characterId="narrator-1SA">
    <verse num="20" />
    <text>It happened, when the time had come, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, saying,</text>

    <text>The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to God the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. </text>

  <block style="p" chapter="1" initialStartVerse="22" characterId="Hannah">
    <text>“Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before God, and stay there forever.”</text>
