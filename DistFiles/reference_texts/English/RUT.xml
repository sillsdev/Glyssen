    <text>Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that God had visited his people in giving them bread.</text>

    <text>So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. It happened, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and [the women] said,</text>

  <block style="p" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="10" characterId="narrator-RUT">
