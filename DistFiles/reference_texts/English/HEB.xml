  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="10" characterId="narrator-HEB">

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="11" characterId="narrator-HEB">

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="3" characterId="narrator-HEB">
    <verse num="3" />

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="4" characterId="narrator-HEB">
    <verse num="4" />

    <verse num="2" />

  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="4" initialStartVerse="3" characterId="narrator-HEB">

  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="4" initialStartVerse="4" characterId="narrator-HEB">

    <text>God again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said), “Today if you will hear his voice, don't harden your hearts.”</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="4" initialStartVerse="8" characterId="narrator-HEB">

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="4" initialStartVerse="12" characterId="narrator-HEB">
    <verse num="12" />
    <text>For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword. It pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</text>

    <text>Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="4" initialStartVerse="16" characterId="narrator-HEB">

    <text>For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.</text>

    <verse num="2" />
    <text>The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="5" initialStartVerse="3" characterId="narrator-HEB">
