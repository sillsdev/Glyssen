    <text>Now, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him, here is what we ask:</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="2" characterId="narrator-2TH">
    <verse num="2" />
    <text>Do not be quickly shaken in your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word. Nor by letter as from us, saying that the day of Christ had come.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="3" characterId="narrator-2TH">
    <verse num="3" />
    <text>Let no one deceive you in any way. For it will not be, unless the departure comes first, and the man of sin is revealed. He is the son of destruction.</text>

    <verse num="4" />
    <text>He opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sits as God in the temple of God, setting himself up as God.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="5" characterId="narrator-2TH">
    <verse num="5" />
    <text>Don’t you remember that, when I was still with you, I told you these things?</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="7" characterId="narrator-2TH">
    <verse num="7" />
    <text>For the mystery of lawlessness already works. Only there is one who restrains now, until he is taken out of the way.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="8" characterId="narrator-2TH">
    <verse num="8" />
    <text>Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth, and destroy by the manifestation of his coming.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="9" characterId="narrator-2TH">
    <verse num="9" />
    <text>The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="10" characterId="narrator-2TH">

  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="11" characterId="narrator-2TH">

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="12" characterId="narrator-2TH">
    <verse num="12" />
    <text>They will all be judged because they didn’t believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="2" initialStartVerse="13" characterId="narrator-2TH">
    <verse num="13" />

    <text>Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion, and not after the tradition which they received from us.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="7" characterId="narrator-2TH">
    <verse num="7" />

    <verse num="8" />
    <text>neither did we eat bread from anyone’s hand without paying for it. In labor and travail we worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you.</text>

  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="9" characterId="narrator-2TH">
    <verse num="9" />
    <text>We did this, not because we don’t have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate us.</text>
  </block>
  <block style="p" paragraphStart="true" chapter="3" initialStartVerse="10" characterId="narrator-2TH">
